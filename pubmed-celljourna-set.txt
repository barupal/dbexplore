AB  - Neurological complications have emerged as a significant cause of morbidity and 
      mortality in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Beside respiratory insufficiency, many 
      hospitalized patients exhibit neurological manifestations ranging from headache and 
      loss of smell, to confusion and disabling strokes. COVID-19 is also anticipated to 
      take a toll on the nervous system in the long term. Here, we will provide a critical 
      appraisal of the potential for neurotropism and mechanisms of neuropathogenesis of 
      SARS-CoV-2 as they relate to the acute and chronic neurological consequences of the 
      infection. Finally, we will examine potential avenues for future research and 
      therapeutic development.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus is causing a 
      global pandemic, and cases continue to rise. Most infected individuals experience 
      mildly symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but it is unknown whether 
      this can induce persistent immune memory that could contribute to immunity. We 
      performed a longitudinal assessment of individuals recovered from mild COVID-19 to 
      determine whether they develop and sustain multifaceted SARS-CoV-2-specific 
      immunological memory. Recovered individuals developed SARS-CoV-2-specific 
      immunoglobulin (IgG) antibodies, neutralizing plasma, and memory B and memory 
      T cells that persisted for at least 3 months. Our data further reveal that 
      SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG memory B cells increased over time. Additionally, 
      SARS-CoV-2-specific memory lymphocytes exhibited characteristics associated with 
      potent antiviral function: memory T cells secreted cytokines and expanded upon 
      antigen re-encounter, whereas memory B cells expressed receptors capable of 
      neutralizing virus when expressed as monoclonal antibodies. Therefore, mild COVID-19 
      elicits memory lymphocytes that persist and display functional hallmarks of 
      antiviral immunity.

AB  - Health is usually defined as the absence of pathology. Here, we endeavor to define 
      health as a compendium of organizational and dynamic features that maintain 
      physiology. The biological causes or hallmarks of health include features of spatial 
      compartmentalization (integrity of barriers and containment of local perturbations), 
      maintenance of homeostasis over time (recycling and turnover, integration of 
      circuitries, and rhythmic oscillations), and an array of adequate responses to 
      stress (homeostatic resilience, hormetic regulation, and repair and regeneration). 
      Disruption of any of these interlocked features is broadly pathogenic, causing an 
      acute or progressive derailment of the system coupled to the loss of numerous 
      stigmata of health.

AB  - Obesity is a major cancer risk factor, but how differences in systemic metabolism 
      change the tumor microenvironment (TME) and impact anti-tumor immunity is not 
      understood. Here, we demonstrate that high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity impairs 
      CD8(+) T cell function in the murine TME, accelerating tumor growth. We generate a 
      single-cell resolution atlas of cellular metabolism in the TME, detailing how it 
      changes with diet-induced obesity. We find that tumor and CD8(+) T cells display 
      distinct metabolic adaptations to obesity. Tumor cells increase fat uptake with HFD, 
      whereas tumor-infiltrating CD8(+) T cells do not. These differential adaptations 
      lead to altered fatty acid partitioning in HFD tumors, impairing CD8(+) T cell 
      infiltration and function. Blocking metabolic reprogramming by tumor cells in obese 
      mice improves anti-tumor immunity. Analysis of human cancers reveals similar 
      transcriptional changes in CD8(+) T cell markers, suggesting interventions that 
      exploit metabolism to improve cancer immunotherapy.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite 
      recent advances in the structural elucidation of SARS-CoV-2 proteins, the detailed 
      architecture of the intact virus remains to be unveiled. Here we report the 
      molecular assembly of the authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus using cryoelectron tomography 
      (cryo-ET) and subtomogram averaging (STA). Native structures of the S proteins in 
      pre- and postfusion conformations were determined to average resolutions of 
      8.7-11 Å. Compositions of the N-linked glycans from the native spikes were analyzed 
      by mass spectrometry, which revealed overall processing states of the native glycans 
      highly similar to that of the recombinant glycoprotein glycans. The native 
      conformation of the ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) and their higher-order assemblies were 
      revealed. Overall, these characterizations revealed the architecture of the 
      SARS-CoV-2 virus in exceptional detail and shed light on how the virus packs its 
      ∼30-kb-long single-segmented RNA in the ∼80-nm-diameter lumen.

AB  - Human organoids recapitulating the cell-type diversity and function of their target 
      organ are valuable for basic and translational research. We developed 
      light-sensitive human retinal organoids with multiple nuclear and synaptic layers 
      and functional synapses. We sequenced the RNA of 285,441 single cells from these 
      organoids at seven developmental time points and from the periphery, fovea, pigment 
      epithelium and choroid of light-responsive adult human retinas, and performed 
      histochemistry. Cell types in organoids matured in vitro to a stable "developed" 
      state at a rate similar to human retina development in vivo. Transcriptomes of 
      organoid cell types converged toward the transcriptomes of adult peripheral retinal 
      cell types. Expression of disease-associated genes was cell-type-specific in adult 
      retina, and cell-type specificity was retained in organoids. We implicate unexpected 
      cell types in diseases such as macular degeneration. This resource identifies 
      cellular targets for studying disease mechanisms in organoids and for targeted 
      repair in human retinas.

AB  - We show that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interacts with both cellular heparan sulfate 
      and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) through its receptor-binding domain 
      (RBD). Docking studies suggest a heparin/heparan sulfate-binding site adjacent to 
      the ACE2-binding site. Both ACE2 and heparin can bind independently to spike protein 
      in vitro, and a ternary complex can be generated using heparin as a scaffold. 
      Electron micrographs of spike protein suggests that heparin enhances the open 
      conformation of the RBD that binds ACE2. On cells, spike protein binding depends on 
      both heparan sulfate and ACE2. Unfractionated heparin, non-anticoagulant heparin, 
      heparin lyases, and lung heparan sulfate potently block spike protein binding and/or 
      infection by pseudotyped virus and authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus. We suggest a model in 
      which viral attachment and infection involves heparan sulfate-dependent enhancement 
      of binding to ACE2. Manipulation of heparan sulfate or inhibition of viral adhesion 
      by exogenous heparin presents new therapeutic opportunities.

AB  - Trained innate immunity, induced via modulation of mature myeloid cells or their 
      bone marrow progenitors, mediates sustained increased responsiveness to secondary 
      challenges. Here, we investigated whether anti-tumor immunity can be enhanced 
      through induction of trained immunity. Pre-treatment of mice with β-glucan, a 
      fungal-derived prototypical agonist of trained immunity, resulted in diminished 
      tumor growth. The anti-tumor effect of β-glucan-induced trained immunity was 
      associated with transcriptomic and epigenetic rewiring of granulopoiesis and 
      neutrophil reprogramming toward an anti-tumor phenotype; this process required type 
      I interferon signaling irrespective of adaptive immunity in the host. Adoptive 
      transfer of neutrophils from β-glucan-trained mice to naive recipients suppressed 
      tumor growth in the latter in a ROS-dependent manner. Moreover, the anti-tumor 
      effect of β-glucan-induced trained granulopoiesis was transmissible by bone marrow 
      transplantation to recipient naive mice. Our findings identify a novel and 
      therapeutically relevant anti-tumor facet of trained immunity involving appropriate 
      rewiring of granulopoiesis.

AB  - Cancer therapies kill tumors either directly or indirectly by evoking immune 
      responses and have been combined with varying levels of success. Here, we describe a 
      paradigm to control cancer growth that is based on both direct tumor killing and the 
      triggering of protective immunity. Genetic ablation of serine protease inhibitor 
      SerpinB9 (Sb9) results in the death of tumor cells in a granzyme B (GrB)-dependent 
      manner. Sb9-deficient mice exhibited protective T cell-based host immunity to tumors 
      in association with a decline in GrB-expressing immunosuppressive cells within the 
      tumor microenvironment (TME). Maximal protection against tumor development was 
      observed when the tumor and host were deficient in Sb9. The therapeutic utility of 
      Sb9 inhibition was demonstrated by the control of tumor growth, resulting in 
      increased survival times in mice. Our studies describe a molecular target that 
      permits a combination of tumor ablation, interference within the TME, and 
      immunotherapy in one potential modality.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is typically 
      very mild and often asymptomatic in children. A complication is the rare multisystem 
      inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) associated with COVID-19, presenting 
      4-6 weeks after infection as high fever, organ dysfunction, and strongly elevated 
      markers of inflammation. The pathogenesis is unclear but has overlapping features 
      with Kawasaki disease suggestive of vasculitis and a likely autoimmune etiology. We 
      apply systems-level analyses of blood immune cells, cytokines, and autoantibodies in 
      healthy children, children with Kawasaki disease enrolled prior to COVID-19, 
      children infected with SARS-CoV-2, and children presenting with MIS-C. We find that 
      the inflammatory response in MIS-C differs from the cytokine storm of severe acute 
      COVID-19, shares several features with Kawasaki disease, but also differs from this 
      condition with respect to T cell subsets, interleukin (IL)-17A, and biomarkers 
      associated with arterial damage. Finally, autoantibody profiling suggests multiple 
      autoantibodies that could be involved in the pathogenesis of MIS-C.

AB  - The enteric nervous system (ENS) coordinates diverse functions in the intestine but 
      has eluded comprehensive molecular characterization because of the rarity and 
      diversity of cells. Here we develop two methods to profile the ENS of adult mice and 
      humans at single-cell resolution: RAISIN RNA-seq for profiling intact nuclei with 
      ribosome-bound mRNA and MIRACL-seq for label-free enrichment of rare cell types by 
      droplet-based profiling. The 1,187,535 nuclei in our mouse atlas include 5,068 
      neurons from the ileum and colon, revealing extraordinary neuron diversity. We 
      highlight circadian expression changes in enteric neurons, show that disease-related 
      genes are dysregulated with aging, and identify differences between the ileum and

AB  - Cell differentiation and function are regulated across multiple layers of gene 
      regulation, including modulation of gene expression by changes in chromatin 
      accessibility. However, differentiation is an asynchronous process precluding a 
      temporal understanding of regulatory events leading to cell fate commitment. Here we 
      developed simultaneous high-throughput ATAC and RNA expression with sequencing 
      (SHARE-seq), a highly scalable approach for measurement of chromatin accessibility 
      and gene expression in the same single cell, applicable to different tissues. Using 
      34,774 joint profiles from mouse skin, we develop a computational strategy to 
      identify cis-regulatory interactions and define domains of regulatory chromatin 
      (DORCs) that significantly overlap with super-enhancers. During lineage commitment, 
      chromatin accessibility at DORCs precedes gene expression, suggesting that changes 
      in chromatin accessibility may prime cells for lineage commitment. We 
      computationally infer chromatin potential as a quantitative measure of chromatin 
      lineage-priming and use it to predict cell fate outcomes. SHARE-seq is an extensible 
      platform to study regulatory circuitry across diverse cells in tissues.

AB  - We employed scRNA sequencing to extensively characterize the cellular landscape of 
      human liver from development to disease. Analysis of ∼212,000 cells representing 
      human fetal, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and mouse liver revealed remarkable 
      fetal-like reprogramming of the tumor microenvironment. Specifically, the HCC 
      ecosystem displayed features reminiscent of fetal development, including 
      re-emergence of fetal-associated endothelial cells (PLVAP/VEGFR2) and fetal-like 
      (FOLR2) tumor-associated macrophages. In a cross-species comparative analysis, we 
      discovered remarkable similarity between mouse embryonic, fetal-liver, and tumor 
      macrophages. Spatial transcriptomics further revealed a shared onco-fetal ecosystem 
      between fetal liver and HCC. Furthermore, gene regulatory analysis, spatial 
      transcriptomics, and in vitro functional assays implicated VEGF and NOTCH signaling 
      in maintaining onco-fetal ecosystem. Taken together, we report a shared 
      immunosuppressive onco-fetal ecosystem in fetal liver and HCC. Our results unravel a 
      previously unexplored onco-fetal reprogramming of the tumor ecosystem, provide novel 
      targets for therapeutic interventions in HCC, and open avenues for identifying 
      similar paradigms in other cancers and disease.

AB  - We present an integrated analysis of the clinical measurements, immune cells, and 
      plasma multi-omics of 139 COVID-19 patients representing all levels of disease 
      severity, from serial blood draws collected during the first week of infection 
      following diagnosis. We identify a major shift between mild and moderate disease, at 
      which point elevated inflammatory signaling is accompanied by the loss of specific 
      classes of metabolites and metabolic processes. Within this stressed plasma 
      environment at moderate disease, multiple unusual immune cell phenotypes emerge and 
      amplify with increasing disease severity. We condensed over 120,000 immune features 
      into a single axis to capture how different immune cell classes coordinate in 
      response to SARS-CoV-2. This immune-response axis independently aligns with the 
      major plasma composition changes, with clinical metrics of blood clotting, and with 
      the sharp transition between mild and moderate disease. This study suggests that 
      moderate disease may provide the most effective setting for therapeutic 
      intervention.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cells will likely prove critical for long-term immune 
      protection against COVID-19. Here, we systematically mapped the functional and 
      phenotypic landscape of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses in unexposed 
      individuals, exposed family members, and individuals with acute or convalescent 
      COVID-19. Acute-phase SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells displayed a highly activated 
      cytotoxic phenotype that correlated with various clinical markers of disease 
      severity, whereas convalescent-phase SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were polyfunctional 
      and displayed a stem-like memory phenotype. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells 
      were detectable in antibody-seronegative exposed family members and convalescent 
      individuals with a history of asymptomatic and mild COVID-19. Our collective dataset 
      shows that SARS-CoV-2 elicits broadly directed and functionally replete memory 
      T cell responses, suggesting that natural exposure or infection may prevent 
      recurrent episodes of severe COVID-19.

AB  - COVID-19 is characterized by excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and 
      acute lung damage associated with patient mortality. While multiple inflammatory 
      cytokines are produced by innate immune cells during SARS-CoV-2 infection, we found 
      that only the combination of TNF-α and IFN-γ induced inflammatory cell death 
      characterized by inflammatory cell death, PANoptosis. Mechanistically, TNF-α and 
      IFN-γ co-treatment activated the JAK/STAT1/IRF1 axis, inducing nitric oxide 
      production and driving caspase-8/FADD-mediated PANoptosis. TNF-α and IFN-γ caused a 
      lethal cytokine shock in mice that mirrors the tissue damage and inflammation of 
      COVID-19, and inhibiting PANoptosis protected mice from this pathology and death. 
      Furthermore, treating with neutralizing antibodies against TNF-α and IFN-γ protected 
      mice from mortality during SARS-CoV-2 infection, sepsis, hemophagocytic 
      lymphohistiocytosis, and cytokine shock. Collectively, our findings suggest that 
      blocking the cytokine-mediated inflammatory cell death signaling pathway identified 
      here may benefit patients with COVID-19 or other infectious and autoinflammatory 
      diseases by limiting tissue damage/inflammation.

AB  - Biliary atresia (BA) is a severe cholangiopathy that leads to liver failure in 
      infants, but its pathogenesis remains to be fully characterized. By single-cell RNA 
      profiling, we observed macrophage hypo-inflammation, Kupffer cell scavenger function 
      defects, cytotoxic T cell expansion, and deficiency of CX3CR1(+)effector T and 
      natural killer (NK) cells in infants with BA. More importantly, we discovered that 
      hepatic B cell lymphopoiesis did not cease after birth and that tolerance defects 
      contributed to immunoglobulin G (IgG)-autoantibody accumulation in BA. In a 
      rhesus-rotavirus induced BA model, depleting B cells or blocking antigen 
      presentation ameliorated liver damage. In a pilot clinical study, we demonstrated 
      that rituximab was effective in depleting hepatic B cells and restoring the 
      functions of macrophages, Kupffer cells, and T cells to levels comparable to those 
      of control subjects. In summary, our comprehensive immune profiling in infants with 
      BA had educed that B-cell-modifying therapies may alleviate liver pathology.

AB  - Limited knowledge is available on the relationship between antigen-specific immune 
      responses and COVID-19 disease severity. We completed a combined examination of all 
      three branches of adaptive immunity at the level of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4(+) and 
      CD8(+) T cell and neutralizing antibody responses in acute and convalescent 
      subjects. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells were each associated with 
      milder disease. Coordinated SARS-CoV-2-specific adaptive immune responses were 
      associated with milder disease, suggesting roles for both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells 
      in protective immunity in COVID-19. Notably, coordination of SARS-CoV-2 
      antigen-specific responses was disrupted in individuals ≥ 65 years old. Scarcity of 
      naive T cells was also associated with aging and poor disease outcomes. A 
      parsimonious explanation is that coordinated CD4(+) T cell, CD8(+) T cell, and 
      antibody responses are protective, but uncoordinated responses frequently fail to 
      control disease, with a connection between aging and impaired adaptive immune 
      responses to SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Genomes have complex three-dimensional architectures. The recent convergence of 
      genetic, biochemical, biophysical, and cell biological methods has uncovered several 
      fundamental principles of genome organization. They highlight that genome function 
      is a major driver of genome architecture and that structural features of chromatin 
      act as modulators, rather than binary determinants, of genome activity. The 
      interplay of these principles in the context of self-organization can account for 
      the emergence of structural chromatin features, the diversity and single-cell 
      heterogeneity of nuclear architecture in cell types and tissues, and explains 
      evolutionarily conserved functional features of genomes, including plasticity and 
      robustness.

AB  - The contribution of CD4(+) T cells to protective or pathogenic immune responses to 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unknown. Here, we present single-cell transcriptomic 
      analysis of >100,000 viral antigen-reactive CD4(+) T cells from 40 COVID-19 
      patients. In hospitalized patients compared to non-hospitalized patients, we found 
      increased proportions of cytotoxic follicular helper cells and cytotoxic T helper 
      (T(H)) cells (CD4-CTLs) responding to SARS-CoV-2 and reduced proportion of 
      SARS-CoV-2-reactive regulatory T cells (T(REG)). Importantly, in hospitalized 
      COVID-19 patients, a strong cytotoxic T(FH) response was observed early in the 
      illness, which correlated negatively with antibody levels to SARS-CoV-2 spike 
      protein. Polyfunctional T(H)1 and T(H)17 cell subsets were underrepresented in the 
      repertoire of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4(+) T cells compared to influenza-reactive 
      CD4(+) T cells. Together, our analyses provide insights into the gene expression 
      patterns of SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4(+) T cells in distinct disease severities.

AB  - Classically considered short-lived and purely defensive leukocytes, neutrophils are 
      unique in their fast and moldable response to stimulation. This plastic behavior may 
      underlie variable and even antagonistic functions during inflammation or cancer, yet 
      the full spectrum of neutrophil properties as they enter healthy tissues remains 
      unexplored. Using a new model to track neutrophil fates, we found short but variable 
      lifetimes across multiple tissues. Through analysis of the receptor, 
      transcriptional, and chromatin accessibility landscapes, we identify varying 
      neutrophil states and assign non-canonical functions, including vascular repair and 
      hematopoietic homeostasis. Accordingly, depletion of neutrophils compromised 
      angiogenesis during early age, genotoxic injury, and viral infection, and impaired 
      hematopoietic recovery after irradiation. Neutrophils acquired these properties in 
      target tissues, a process that, in the lungs, occurred in CXCL12-rich areas and 
      relied on CXCR4. Our results reveal that tissues co-opt neutrophils en route for 
      elimination to induce programs that support their physiological demands.

TI  - Targeting Mitochondria-Located circRNA SCAR Alleviates NASH via Reducing mROS 
      Output.

AB  - Mitochondria, which play central roles in immunometabolic diseases, have their own 
      genome. However, the functions of mitochondria-located noncoding RNAs are largely 
      unknown due to the absence of a specific delivery system. By circular RNA (circRNA) 
      expression profile analysis of liver fibroblasts from patients with nonalcoholic 
      steatohepatitis (NASH), we observe that mitochondrial circRNAs account for a 
      considerable fraction of downregulated circRNAs in NASH fibroblasts. By constructing 
      mitochondria-targeting nanoparticles, we observe that Steatohepatitis-associated 
      circRNA ATP5B Regulator (SCAR), which is located in mitochondria, inhibits 
      mitochondrial ROS (mROS) output and fibroblast activation. circRNA SCAR, mediated by 
      PGC-1α, binds to ATP5B and shuts down mPTP by blocking CypD-mPTP interaction. Lipid 
      overload inhibits PGC-1α by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced CHOP. In vivo, 
      targeting circRNA SCAR alleviates high fat diet-induced cirrhosis and insulin 
      resistance. Clinically, circRNA SCAR is associated with steatosis-to-NASH 
      progression. Collectively, we identify a mitochondrial circRNA that drives 
      metaflammation and serves as a therapeutic target for NASH.

AB  - Regulation of biological processes typically incorporates mechanisms that initiate 
      and terminate the process and, where understood, these mechanisms often involve 
      feedback control. Regulation of transcription is a fundamental cellular process 
      where the mechanisms involved in initiation have been studied extensively, but those 
      involved in arresting the process are poorly understood. Modeling of the potential 
      roles of RNA in transcriptional control suggested a non-equilibrium feedback control 
      mechanism where low levels of RNA promote condensates formed by electrostatic 
      interactions whereas relatively high levels promote dissolution of these 
      condensates. Evidence from in vitro and in vivo experiments support a model where 
      RNAs produced during early steps in transcription initiation stimulate condensate 
      formation, whereas the burst of RNAs produced during elongation stimulate condensate 
      dissolution. We propose that transcriptional regulation incorporates a feedback 
      mechanism whereby transcribed RNAs initially stimulate but then ultimately arrest 
      the process.

AB  - Humoral responses in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are often of limited 
      durability, as seen with other human coronavirus epidemics. To address the 
      underlying etiology, we examined post mortem thoracic lymph nodes and spleens in 
      acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and observed the absence of germinal centers and a 
      striking reduction in Bcl-6(+) germinal center B cells but preservation of AID(+) B 
      cells. Absence of germinal centers correlated with an early specific block in 
      Bcl-6(+) T(FH) cell differentiation together with an increase in T-bet(+) T(H1) 
      cells and aberrant extra-follicular TNF-α accumulation. Parallel peripheral blood 
      studies revealed loss of transitional and follicular B cells in severe disease and 
      accumulation of SARS-CoV-2-specific "disease-related" B cell populations. These data 
      identify defective Bcl-6(+) T(FH) cell generation and dysregulated humoral immune 
      induction early in COVID-19 disease, providing a mechanistic explanation for the 
      limited durability of antibody responses in coronavirus infections, and suggest that 
      achieving herd immunity through natural infection may be difficult.

AB  - Hematopoiesis has long served as a paradigm of stem cell biology and tissue 
      homeostasis. In the past decade, the genomics revolution has ushered in powerful new 
      methods for investigating the hematopoietic system that have provided transformative 
      insights into its biology. As part of the advances in genomics, increasingly 
      accurate deep sequencing and novel methods of cell tracking have revealed 
      hematopoiesis to be more of a continuous and less of a discrete and punctuated 
      process than originally envisioned. In part, this continuous nature of hematopoiesis 
      is made possible by the emergent outcomes of vast, interconnected regulatory 
      networks that influence cell fates and lineage commitment. It is also becoming clear 
      how these mechanisms are modulated by genetic variation present throughout the 
      population. This review describes how these recently uncovered complexities are 
      reshaping our concept of tissue development and homeostasis while opening up a more 
      comprehensive future understanding of hematopoiesis.

TI  - TDP-43 Triggers Mitochondrial DNA Release via mPTP to Activate cGAS/STING in ALS.
PG  - 636-649.e18

AB  - Cytoplasmic accumulation of TDP-43 is a disease hallmark for many cases of 
      amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), associated with a neuroinflammatory cytokine 
      profile related to upregulation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and type I interferon 
      (IFN) pathways. Here we show that this inflammation is driven by the cytoplasmic DNA 
      sensor cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP)-AMP synthase (cGAS) when TDP-43 invades 
      mitochondria and releases DNA via the permeability transition pore. Pharmacologic 
      inhibition or genetic deletion of cGAS and its downstream signaling partner STING 
      prevents upregulation of NF-κB and type I IFN induced by TDP-43 in induced 
      pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived motor neurons and in TDP-43 mutant mice. 
      Finally, we document elevated levels of the specific cGAS signaling metabolite cGAMP 
      in spinal cord samples from patients, which may be a biomarker of mtDNA release and 
      cGAS/STING activation in ALS. Our results identify mtDNA release and cGAS/STING 
      activation as critical determinants of TDP-43-associated pathology and demonstrate 
      the potential for targeting this pathway in ALS.

AB  - Blood myeloid cells are known to be dysregulated in coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2. It is unknown whether the innate myeloid response 
      differs with disease severity and whether markers of innate immunity discriminate 
      high-risk patients. Thus, we performed high-dimensional flow cytometry and 
      single-cell RNA sequencing of COVID-19 patient peripheral blood cells and detected 
      disappearance of non-classical CD14(Low)CD16(High) monocytes, accumulation of 
      HLA-DR(Low) classical monocytes (Human Leukocyte Antigen - DR isotype), and release 
      of massive amounts of calprotectin (S100A8/S100A9) in severe cases. Immature 
      CD10(Low)CD101(-)CXCR4(+/-) neutrophils with an immunosuppressive profile 
      accumulated in the blood and lungs, suggesting emergency myelopoiesis. Finally, we 
      show that calprotectin plasma level and a routine flow cytometry assay detecting 
      decreased frequencies of non-classical monocytes could discriminate patients who 
      develop a severe form of COVID-19, suggesting a predictive value that deserves 
      prospective evaluation.

AB  - Retrons are bacterial genetic elements comprised of a reverse transcriptase (RT) and 
      a non-coding RNA (ncRNA). The RT uses the ncRNA as template, generating a chimeric 
      RNA/DNA molecule in which the RNA and DNA components are covalently linked. Although 
      retrons were discovered three decades ago, their function remained unknown. We 
      report that retrons function as anti-phage defense systems. The defensive unit is 
      composed of three components: the RT, the ncRNA, and an effector protein. We 
      examined multiple retron systems and show that they confer defense against a broad 
      range of phages via abortive infection. Focusing on retron Ec48, we show evidence 
      that it "guards" RecBCD, a complex with central anti-phage functions in bacteria. 
      Inhibition of RecBCD by phage proteins activates the retron, leading to abortive 
      infection and cell death. Thus, the Ec48 retron forms a second line of defense that 
      is triggered if the first lines of defense have collapsed.

AB  - The non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) SHP2, encoded by PTPN11, plays 
      an essential role in RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling during 
      normal development. It has been perplexing as to why both enzymatically activating 
      and inactivating mutations in PTPN11 result in human developmental disorders with 
      overlapping clinical manifestations. Here, we uncover a common liquid-liquid phase 
      separation (LLPS) behavior shared by these disease-associated SHP2 mutants. SHP2 
      LLPS is mediated by the conserved well-folded PTP domain through multivalent 
      electrostatic interactions and regulated by an intrinsic autoinhibitory mechanism 
      through conformational changes. SHP2 allosteric inhibitors can attenuate LLPS of 
      SHP2 mutants, which boosts SHP2 PTP activity. Moreover, disease-associated SHP2 
      mutants can recruit and activate wild-type (WT) SHP2 in LLPS to promote MAPK 
      activation. These results not only suggest that LLPS serves as a gain-of-function 
      mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of SHP2-associated human diseases but also 
      provide evidence that PTP may be regulated by LLPS that can be therapeutically 
      targeted.

AB  - We present deterministic barcoding in tissue for spatial omics sequencing (DBiT-seq) 
      for co-mapping of mRNAs and proteins in a formaldehyde-fixed tissue slide via 
      next-generation sequencing (NGS). Parallel microfluidic channels were used to 
      deliver DNA barcodes to the surface of a tissue slide, and crossflow of two sets of 
      barcodes, A1-50 and B1-50, followed by ligation in situ, yielded a 2D mosaic of 
      tissue pixels, each containing a unique full barcode AB. Application to mouse 
      embryos revealed major tissue types in early organogenesis as well as fine features 
      like microvasculature in a brain and pigmented epithelium in an eye field. Gene 
      expression profiles in 10-μm pixels conformed into the clusters of single-cell 
      transcriptomes, allowing for rapid identification of cell types and spatial 
      distributions. DBiT-seq can be adopted by researchers with no experience in 
      microfluidics and may find applications in a range of fields including developmental 
      biology, cancer biology, neuroscience, and clinical pathology.

AB  - The microbiota shields the host against infections in a process known as 
      colonization resistance. How infections themselves shape this fundamental process 
      remains largely unknown. Here, we show that gut microbiota from previously infected 
      hosts display enhanced resistance to infection. This long-term functional remodeling 
      is associated with altered bile acid metabolism leading to the expansion of taxa 
      that utilize the sulfonic acid taurine. Notably, supplying exogenous taurine alone 
      is sufficient to induce this alteration in microbiota function and enhance 
      resistance. Mechanistically, taurine potentiates the microbiota's production of 
      sulfide, an inhibitor of cellular respiration, which is key to host invasion by 
      numerous pathogens. As such, pharmaceutical sequestration of sulfide perturbs the 
      microbiota's composition and promotes pathogen invasion. Together, this work reveals 
      a process by which the host, triggered by infection, can deploy taurine as a 
      nutrient to nourish and train the microbiota, promoting its resistance to subsequent 
      infection.

TI  - β-Coronaviruses Use Lysosomes for Egress Instead of the Biosynthetic Secretory 
      Pathway.

AB  - β-Coronaviruses are a family of positive-strand enveloped RNA viruses that includes 
      the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Much is known 
      regarding their cellular entry and replication pathways, but their mode of egress 
      remains uncertain. Using imaging methodologies and virus-specific reporters, we 
      demonstrate that β-coronaviruses utilize lysosomal trafficking for egress rather 
      than the biosynthetic secretory pathway more commonly used by other enveloped 
      viruses. This unconventional egress is regulated by the Arf-like small GTPase Arl8b 
      and can be blocked by the Rab7 GTPase competitive inhibitor CID1067700. Such 
      non-lytic release of β-coronaviruses results in lysosome deacidification, 
      inactivation of lysosomal degradation enzymes, and disruption of antigen 
      presentation pathways. β-Coronavirus-induced exploitation of lysosomal organelles 
      for egress provides insights into the cellular and immunological abnormalities 
      observed in patients and suggests new therapeutic modalities.

AB  - Lymphocyte migration is essential for adaptive immune surveillance. However, our 
      current understanding of this process is rudimentary, because most human studies 
      have been restricted to immunological analyses of blood and various tissues. To 
      address this knowledge gap, we used an integrated approach to characterize 
      tissue-emigrant lineages in thoracic duct lymph (TDL). The most prevalent immune 
      cells in human and non-human primate efferent lymph were T cells. Cytolytic CD8(+) 
      T cell subsets with effector-like epigenetic and transcriptional signatures were 
      clonotypically skewed and selectively confined to the intravascular circulation, 
      whereas non-cytolytic CD8(+) T cell subsets with stem-like epigenetic and 
      transcriptional signatures predominated in tissues and TDL. Moreover, these 
      anatomically distinct gene expression profiles were recapitulated within individual 
      clonotypes, suggesting parallel differentiation programs independent of the 
      expressed antigen receptor. Our collective dataset provides an atlas of the 
      migratory immune system and defines the nature of tissue-emigrant CD8(+) T cells 
      that recirculate via TDL.

AB  - Identification of host genes essential for severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection may reveal novel therapeutic targets and inform 
      our understanding of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pathogenesis. Here we 
      performed genome-wide CRISPR screens in Vero-E6 cells with SARS-CoV-2, Middle East 
      respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), bat CoV HKU5 expressing the SARS-CoV-1 spike, 
      and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike. We identified 
      known SARS-CoV-2 host factors, including the receptor ACE2 and protease Cathepsin L. 
      We additionally discovered pro-viral genes and pathways, including HMGB1 and the 
      SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, that are SARS lineage and pan-coronavirus 
      specific, respectively. We show that HMGB1 regulates ACE2 expression and is critical 
      for entry of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-1, and NL63. We also show that small-molecule 
      antagonists of identified gene products inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in monkey and 
      human cells, demonstrating the conserved role of these genetic hits across species. 
      This identifies potential therapeutic targets for SARS-CoV-2 and reveals SARS 
      lineage-specific and pan-CoV host factors that regulate susceptibility to highly 
      pathogenic CoVs.

AB  - Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumors have a nutrient-poor, desmoplastic, 
      and highly innervated tumor microenvironment. Although neurons can release 
      stimulatory factors to accelerate PDAC tumorigenesis, the metabolic contribution of 
      peripheral axons has not been explored. We found that peripheral axons release 
      serine (Ser) to support the growth of exogenous Ser (exSer)-dependent PDAC cells 
      during Ser/Gly (glycine) deprivation. Ser deprivation resulted in ribosomal stalling 
      on two of the six Ser codons, TCC and TCT, and allowed the selective translation and 
      secretion of nerve growth factor (NGF) by PDAC cells to promote tumor innervation. 
      Consistent with this, exSer-dependent PDAC tumors grew slower and displayed enhanced 
      innervation in mice on a Ser/Gly-free diet. Blockade of compensatory neuronal 
      innervation using LOXO-101, a Trk-NGF inhibitor, further decreased PDAC tumor 
      growth. Our data indicate that axonal-cancer metabolic crosstalk is a critical 
      adaptation to support PDAC growth in nutrient poor environments.

AB  - Persistent cancer cells are the discrete and usually undetected cells that survive 
      cancer drug treatment and constitute a major cause of treatment failure. These cells 
      are characterized by their slow proliferation, highly flexible energy consumption, 
      adaptation to their microenvironment, and phenotypic plasticity. Mechanisms that 
      underlie their persistence offer highly coveted and sought-after therapeutic 
      targets, and include diverse epigenetic, transcriptional, and translational 
      regulatory processes, as well as complex cell-cell interactions. Although the 
      successful clinical targeting of persistent cancer cells remains to be realized, 
      immense progress has been made in understanding their persistence, yielding 
      promising preclinical results.

AB  - To better understand host-virus genetic dependencies and find potential therapeutic 
      targets for COVID-19, we performed a genome-scale CRISPR loss-of-function screen to 
      identify host factors required for SARS-CoV-2 viral infection of human alveolar 
      epithelial cells. Top-ranked genes cluster into distinct pathways, including the 
      vacuolar ATPase proton pump, Retromer, and Commander complexes. We validate these 
      gene targets using several orthogonal methods such as CRISPR knockout, RNA 
      interference knockdown, and small-molecule inhibitors. Using single-cell 
      RNA-sequencing, we identify shared transcriptional changes in cholesterol 
      biosynthesis upon loss of top-ranked genes. In addition, given the key role of the 
      ACE2 receptor in the early stages of viral entry, we show that loss of RAB7A reduces 
      viral entry by sequestering the ACE2 receptor inside cells. Overall, this work 
      provides a genome-scale, quantitative resource of the impact of the loss of each 
      host gene on fitness/response to viral infection.

AB  - Neurons in the cerebral cortex connect through descending pathways to hindbrain and 
      spinal cord to activate muscle and generate movement. Although components of this 
      pathway have been previously generated and studied in vitro, the assembly of this 
      multi-synaptic circuit has not yet been achieved with human cells. Here, we derive 
      organoids resembling the cerebral cortex or the hindbrain/spinal cord and assemble 
      them with human skeletal muscle spheroids to generate 3D cortico-motor assembloids. 
      Using rabies tracing, calcium imaging, and patch-clamp recordings, we show that 
      corticofugal neurons project and connect with spinal spheroids, while spinal-derived 
      motor neurons connect with muscle. Glutamate uncaging or optogenetic stimulation of 
      cortical spheroids triggers robust contraction of 3D muscle, and assembloids are 
      morphologically and functionally intact for up to 10 weeks post-fusion. Together, 
      this system highlights the remarkable self-assembly capacity of 3D cultures to form 
      functional circuits that could be used to understand development and disease.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) exhibits variable symptom severity ranging from 
      asymptomatic to life-threatening, yet the relationship between severity and the 
      humoral immune response is poorly understood. We examined antibody responses in 113 
      COVID-19 patients and found that severe cases resulting in intubation or death 
      exhibited increased inflammatory markers, lymphopenia, pro-inflammatory cytokines, 
      and high anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) antibody levels. Although anti-RBD 
      immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels generally correlated with neutralization titer, 
      quantitation of neutralization potency revealed that high potency was a predictor of 
      survival. In addition to neutralization of wild-type SARS-CoV-2, patient sera were 
      also able to neutralize the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 mutant D614G, suggesting 
      cross-protection from reinfection by either strain. However, SARS-CoV-2 sera 
      generally lacked cross-neutralization to a highly homologous pre-emergent bat 
      coronavirus, WIV1-CoV, which has not yet crossed the species barrier. These results 
      highlight the importance of neutralizing humoral immunity on disease progression and 
      the need to develop broadly protective interventions to prevent future coronavirus 
      pandemics.

AB  - Hallucinogens like lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin, and substituted 
      N-benzyl phenylalkylamines are widely used recreationally with psilocybin being 
      considered as a therapeutic for many neuropsychiatric disorders including 
      depression, anxiety, and substance abuse. How psychedelics mediate their 
      actions-both therapeutic and hallucinogenic-are not understood, although activation 
      of the 5-HT(2A) serotonin receptor (HTR2A) is key. To gain molecular insights into 
      psychedelic actions, we determined the active-state structure of HTR2A bound to 
      25-CN-NBOH-a prototypical hallucinogen-in complex with an engineered Gαq 
      heterotrimer by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM). We also obtained the X-ray 
      crystal structures of HTR2A complexed with the arrestin-biased ligand LSD or the 
      inverse agonist methiothepin. Comparisons of these structures reveal determinants 
      responsible for HTR2A-Gαq protein interactions as well as the conformational 
      rearrangements involved in active-state transitions. Given the potential therapeutic 
      actions of hallucinogens, these findings could accelerate the discovery of more 
      selective drugs for the treatment of a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders.

AB  - Collective metastasis is defined as the cohesive migration and metastasis of 
      multicellular tumor cell clusters. Disrupting various cell adhesion genes markedly 
      reduces cluster formation and colonization efficiency, yet the downstream signals 
      transmitted by clustering remain largely unknown. Here, we use mouse and human 
      breast cancer models to identify a collective signal generated by tumor cell 
      clusters supporting metastatic colonization. We show that tumor cell clusters 
      produce the growth factor epigen and concentrate it within nanolumina-intercellular 
      compartments sealed by cell-cell junctions and lined with microvilli-like 
      protrusions. Epigen knockdown profoundly reduces metastatic outgrowth and switches 
      clusters from a proliferative to a collective migratory state. Tumor cell clusters 
      from basal-like 2, but not mesenchymal-like, triple-negative breast cancer cell 
      lines have increased epigen expression, sealed nanolumina, and impaired outgrowth 
      upon nanolumenal junction disruption. We propose that nanolumenal signaling could 
      offer a therapeutic target for aggressive metastatic breast cancers.

AB  - Analysis of the specificity and kinetics of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) elicited 
      by SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial for understanding immune protection and 
      identifying targets for vaccine design. In a cohort of 647 SARS-CoV-2-infected 
      subjects, we found that both the magnitude of Ab responses to SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) 
      and nucleoprotein and nAb titers correlate with clinical scores. The 
      receptor-binding domain (RBD) is immunodominant and the target of 90% of the 
      neutralizing activity present in SARS-CoV-2 immune sera. Whereas overall 
      RBD-specific serum IgG titers waned with a half-life of 49 days, nAb titers and 
      avidity increased over time for some individuals, consistent with affinity 
      maturation. We structurally defined an RBD antigenic map and serologically 
      quantified serum Abs specific for distinct RBD epitopes leading to the 
      identification of two major receptor-binding motif antigenic sites. Our results 
      explain the immunodominance of the receptor-binding motif and will guide the design 
      of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics.

AB  - Metabolic reprogramming is a key feature of many cancers, but how and when it 
      contributes to tumorigenesis remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that metabolic 
      reprogramming induced by mitochondrial fusion can be rate-limiting for 
      immortalization of tumor-initiating cells (TICs) and trigger their irreversible 
      dedication to tumorigenesis. Using single-cell transcriptomics, we find that 
      Drosophila brain tumors contain a rapidly dividing stem cell population defined by 
      upregulation of oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). We combine targeted metabolomics 
      and in vivo genetic screening to demonstrate that OxPhos is required for tumor cell 
      immortalization but dispensable in neural stem cells (NSCs) giving rise to tumors. 
      Employing an in vivo NADH/NAD(+) sensor, we show that NSCs precisely increase OxPhos 
      during immortalization. Blocking OxPhos or mitochondrial fusion stalls TICs in 
      quiescence and prevents tumorigenesis through impaired NAD(+) regeneration. Our work 
      establishes a unique connection between cellular metabolism and immortalization of 
      tumor-initiating cells.

AB  - Initially, children were thought to be spared from disease caused by severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, a month into the epidemic, 
      a novel multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) emerged. Herein, we 
      report on the immune profiles of nine MIS-C cases. All MIS-C patients had evidence 
      of prior SARS-CoV-2 exposure, mounting an antibody response with intact 
      neutralization capability. Cytokine profiling identified elevated signatures of 
      inflammation (IL-18 and IL-6), lymphocytic and myeloid chemotaxis and activation 
      (CCL3, CCL4, and CDCP1), and mucosal immune dysregulation (IL-17A, CCL20, and 
      CCL28). Immunophenotyping of peripheral blood revealed reductions of non-classical 
      monocytes, and subsets of NK and T lymphocytes, suggesting extravasation to affected 
      tissues. Finally, profiling the autoantigen reactivity of MIS-C plasma revealed both 
      known disease-associated autoantibodies (anti-La) and novel candidates that 
      recognize endothelial, gastrointestinal, and immune-cell antigens. All patients were 
      treated with anti-IL-6R antibody and/or IVIG, which led to rapid disease resolution.

AB  - The gut microbiome has been implicated in multiple human chronic gastrointestinal 
      (GI) disorders. Determining its mechanistic role in disease has been difficult due 
      to apparent disconnects between animal and human studies and lack of an integrated 
      multi-omics view of disease-specific physiological changes. We integrated 
      longitudinal multi-omics data from the gut microbiome, metabolome, host epigenome, 
      and transcriptome in the context of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) host physiology. 
      We identified IBS subtype-specific and symptom-related variation in microbial 
      composition and function. A subset of identified changes in microbial metabolites 
      correspond to host physiological mechanisms that are relevant to IBS. By integrating 
      multiple data layers, we identified purine metabolism as a novel host-microbial 
      metabolic pathway in IBS with translational potential. Our study highlights the 
      importance of longitudinal sampling and integrating complementary multi-omics data 
      to identify functional mechanisms that can serve as therapeutic targets in a 
      comprehensive treatment strategy for chronic GI diseases. VIDEO ABSTRACT.

AB  - Cancer cells enter a reversible drug-tolerant persister (DTP) state to evade death 
      from chemotherapy and targeted agents. It is increasingly appreciated that DTPs are 
      important drivers of therapy failure and tumor relapse. We combined cellular 
      barcoding and mathematical modeling in patient-derived colorectal cancer models to 
      identify and characterize DTPs in response to chemotherapy. Barcode analysis 
      revealed no loss of clonal complexity of tumors that entered the DTP state and 
      recurred following treatment cessation. Our data fit a mathematical model where all 
      cancer cells, and not a small subpopulation, possess an equipotent capacity to 
      become DTPs. Mechanistically, we determined that DTPs display remarkable 
      transcriptional and functional similarities to diapause, a reversible state of 
      suspended embryonic development triggered by unfavorable environmental conditions. 
      Our study provides insight into how cancer cells use a developmentally conserved 
      mechanism to drive the DTP state, pointing to novel therapeutic opportunities to 
      target DTPs.

AB  - Large scientific projects in genomics and astronomy are influential not because they 
      answer any single question but because they enable investigation of continuously 
      arising new questions from the same data-rich sources. Advances in automated mapping 
      of the brain's synaptic connections (connectomics) suggest that the complicated 
      circuits underlying brain function are ripe for analysis. We discuss benefits of 
      mapping a mouse brain at the level of synapses.

AB  - Flaviviruses pose a constant threat to human health. These RNA viruses are 
      transmitted by the bite of infected mosquitoes and ticks and regularly cause 
      outbreaks. To identify host factors required for flavivirus infection, we performed 
      full-genome loss of function CRISPR-Cas9 screens. Based on these results, we focused 
      our efforts on characterizing the roles that TMEM41B and VMP1 play in the virus 
      replication cycle. Our mechanistic studies on TMEM41B revealed that all members of 
      the Flaviviridae family that we tested require TMEM41B. We tested 12 additional 
      virus families and found that SARS-CoV-2 of the Coronaviridae also required TMEM41B 
      for infection. Remarkably, single nucleotide polymorphisms present at nearly 20% in 
      East Asian populations reduce flavivirus infection. Based on our mechanistic 
      studies, we propose that TMEM41B is recruited to flavivirus RNA replication 
      complexes to facilitate membrane curvature, which creates a protected environment 
      for viral genome replication.

AB  - The Coronaviridae are a family of viruses that cause disease in humans ranging from 
      mild respiratory infection to potentially lethal acute respiratory distress 
      syndrome. Finding host factors common to multiple coronaviruses could facilitate the 
      development of therapies to combat current and future coronavirus pandemics. Here, 
      we conducted genome-wide CRISPR screens in cells infected by SARS-CoV-2 as well as 
      two seasonally circulating common cold coronaviruses, OC43 and 229E. This approach 
      correctly identified the distinct viral entry factors ACE2 (for SARS-CoV-2), 
      aminopeptidase N (for 229E), and glycosaminoglycans (for OC43). Additionally, we 
      identified phosphatidylinositol phosphate biosynthesis and cholesterol homeostasis 
      as critical host pathways supporting infection by all three coronaviruses. By 
      contrast, the lysosomal protein TMEM106B appeared unique to SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
      Pharmacological inhibition of phosphatidylinositol kinases and cholesterol 
      homeostasis reduced replication of all three coronaviruses. These findings offer 
      important insights for the understanding of the coronavirus life cycle and the 
      development of host-directed therapies.

AB  - Widespread changes to DNA methylation and chromatin are well documented in cancer, 
      but the fate of higher-order chromosomal structure remains obscure. Here we 
      integrated topological maps for colon tumors and normal colons with epigenetic, 
      transcriptional, and imaging data to characterize alterations to chromatin loops, 
      topologically associated domains, and large-scale compartments. We found that 
      spatial partitioning of the open and closed genome compartments is profoundly 
      compromised in tumors. This reorganization is accompanied by compartment-specific 
      hypomethylation and chromatin changes. Additionally, we identify a compartment at 
      the interface between the canonical A and B compartments that is reorganized in 
      tumors. Remarkably, similar shifts were evident in non-malignant cells that have 
      accumulated excess divisions. Our analyses suggest that these topological changes 
      repress stemness and invasion programs while inducing anti-tumor immunity genes and 
      may therefore restrain malignant progression. Our findings call into question the 
      conventional view that tumor-associated epigenomic alterations are primarily 
      oncogenic.

AB  - Interferon (IFN)-Is are crucial mediators of antiviral immunity and homeostatic 
      immune system regulation. However, the source of IFN-I signaling under homeostatic 
      conditions is unclear. We discovered that commensal microbes regulate the IFN-I 
      response through induction of IFN-β by colonic DCs. Moreover, the mechanism by which 
      a specific commensal microbe induces IFN-β was identified. Outer membrane 
      (OM)-associated glycolipids of gut commensal microbes belonging to the Bacteroidetes 
      phylum induce expression of IFN-β. Using Bacteroides fragilis and its OM-associated 
      polysaccharide A, we determined that IFN-β expression was induced via TLR4-TRIF 
      signaling. Antiviral activity of this purified microbial molecule against infection 
      with either vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) or influenza was demonstrated to be 
      dependent on the induction of IFN-β. In a murine VSV infection model, 
      commensal-induced IFN-β regulated natural resistance to virus infection. Due to the 
      physiological importance of IFN-Is, discovery of an IFN-β-inducing microbial 
      molecule represents a potential approach for the treatment of some human diseases.

AB  - The escalating social and economic burden of an aging world population has placed 
      aging research at center stage. The hallmarks of aging comprise diverse molecular 
      mechanisms and cellular systems that are interrelated and act in concert to drive 
      the aging process. Here, through the lens of telomere biology, we examine how 
      telomere dysfunction may amplify or drive molecular biological processes underlying 
      each hallmark of aging and contribute to development of age-related diseases such as 
      neurodegeneration and cancer. The intimate link of telomeres to aging hallmarks 
      informs preventive and therapeutic interventions designed to attenuate aging itself 
      and reduce the incidence of age-associated diseases.

AB  - During respiration, humans breathe in more than 10,000 liters of non-sterile air 
      daily, allowing some pathogens access to alveoli. Interestingly, alveoli outnumber 
      alveolar macrophages (AMs), which favors alveoli devoid of AMs. If AMs, like most 
      tissue macrophages, are sessile, then this numerical advantage would be exploited by 
      pathogens unless neutrophils from the blood stream intervened. However, this would 
      translate to omnipresent persistent inflammation. Developing in vivo real-time 
      intravital imaging of alveoli revealed AMs crawling in and between alveoli using the 
      pores of Kohn. Importantly, these macrophages sensed, chemotaxed, and, with high 
      efficiency, phagocytosed inhaled bacterial pathogens such as P. aeruginosa and 
      S. aureus, cloaking the bacteria from neutrophils. Impairing AM chemotaxis toward 
      bacteria induced superfluous neutrophil recruitment, leading to inappropriate 
      inflammation and injury. In a disease context, influenza A virus infection impaired 
      AM crawling via the type II interferon signaling pathway, and this greatly increased 
      secondary bacterial co-infection.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused extreme human suffering and economic harm. We 
      generated and characterized a new mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 virus that captures 
      multiple aspects of severe COVID-19 disease in standard laboratory mice. This 
      SARS-CoV-2 model exhibits the spectrum of morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 
      disease as well as aspects of host genetics, age, cellular tropisms, elevated Th1 
      cytokines, and loss of surfactant expression and pulmonary function linked to 
      pathological features of acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress 
      syndrome (ARDS). This model can rapidly access existing mouse resources to elucidate 
      the role of host genetics, underlying molecular mechanisms governing SARS-CoV-2 
      pathogenesis, and the protective or pathogenic immune responses related to disease 
      severity. The model promises to provide a robust platform for studies of ALI and 
      ARDS to evaluate vaccine and antiviral drug performance, including in the most 
      vulnerable populations (i.e., the aged) using standard laboratory mice.

AB  - Transcriptome studies reveal pervasive transcription of complex genomes, such as 
      those of mammals. Despite popular arguments for functionality of most, if not all, 
      of these transcripts, genome-wide analysis of selective constraints indicates that 
      most of the produced RNA are junk. However, junk is not garbage. On the contrary, 
      junk transcripts provide the raw material for the evolution of diverse long 
      non-coding (lnc) RNAs by non-adaptive mechanisms, such as constructive neutral 
      evolution. The generation of many novel functional entities, such as lncRNAs, that 
      fuels organismal complexity does not seem to be driven by strong positive selection. 
      Rather, the weak selection regime that dominates the evolution of most multicellular

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a recently 
      identified coronavirus that causes the respiratory disease known as coronavirus 
      disease 2019 (COVID-19). Despite the urgent need, we still do not fully understand 
      the molecular basis of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Here, we comprehensively define the 
      interactions between SARS-CoV-2 proteins and human RNAs. NSP16 binds to the mRNA 
      recognition domains of the U1 and U2 splicing RNAs and acts to suppress global mRNA 
      splicing upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. NSP1 binds to 18S ribosomal RNA in the mRNA 
      entry channel of the ribosome and leads to global inhibition of mRNA translation 
      upon infection. Finally, NSP8 and NSP9 bind to the 7SL RNA in the signal recognition 
      particle and interfere with protein trafficking to the cell membrane upon infection. 
      Disruption of each of these essential cellular functions acts to suppress the 
      interferon response to viral infection. Our results uncover a multipronged strategy 
      utilized by SARS-CoV-2 to antagonize essential cellular processes to suppress host 
      defenses.

AB  - Understanding which arms of the immune response are responsible for protection 
      against SARS-CoV-2 infection is key to predicting long-term immunity and to inform 
      vaccine design. Two studies in this issue of Cell collectively suggest that, 
      although SARS-CoV-2 infection may blunt long-lived antibody responses, immune memory 
      might still be achieved through virus-specific memory T cells.

AB  - Development of the human intestine is not well understood. Here, we link single-cell 
      RNA sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to characterize intestinal morphogenesis 
      through time. We identify 101 cell states including epithelial and mesenchymal 
      progenitor populations and programs linked to key morphogenetic milestones. We 
      describe principles of crypt-villus axis formation; neural, vascular, mesenchymal 
      morphogenesis, and immune population of the developing gut. We identify the 
      differentiation hierarchies of developing fibroblast and myofibroblast subtypes and 
      describe diverse functions for these including as vascular niche cells. We pinpoint 
      the origins of Peyer's patches and gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and 
      describe location-specific immune programs. We use our resource to present an 
      unbiased analysis of morphogen gradients that direct sequential waves of cellular 
      differentiation and define cells and locations linked to rare developmental 
      intestinal disorders. We compile a publicly available online resource, 
      spatio-temporal analysis resource of fetal intestinal development (STAR-FINDer), to 
      facilitate further work.

AB  - Re-activation and clonal expansion of tumor-specific antigen (TSA)-reactive T cells 
      are critical to the success of checkpoint blockade and adoptive transfer of 
      tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL)-based therapies. There are no reliable markers 
      to specifically identify the repertoire of TSA-reactive T cells due to their 
      heterogeneous composition. We introduce FucoID as a general platform to detect 
      endogenous antigen-specific T cells for studying their biology. Through this 
      interaction-dependent labeling approach, intratumoral TSA-reactive CD4(+), CD8(+) 
      T cells, and TSA-suppressive CD4(+) T cells can be detected and separated from 
      bystander T cells based on their cell-surface enzymatic fucosyl-biotinylation. 
      Compared to bystander TILs, TSA-reactive TILs possess a distinct T cell receptor 
      (TCR) repertoire and unique gene features. Although exhibiting a dysfunctional 
      phenotype, TSA-reactive CD8(+) TILs possess substantial capabilities of 
      proliferation and tumor-specific killing. Featuring genetic manipulation-free 
      procedures and a quick turnover cycle, FucoID should have the potential of 
      accelerating the pace of personalized cancer treatment.

AB  - The urgent need for an effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine has forced development to 
      progress in the absence of well-defined correlates of immunity. While neutralization 
      has been linked to protection against other pathogens, whether neutralization alone 
      will be sufficient to drive protection against SARS-CoV-2 in the broader population 
      remains unclear. Therefore, to fully define protective humoral immunity, we 
      dissected the early evolution of the humoral response in 193 hospitalized 
      individuals ranging from moderate to severe. Although robust IgM and IgA responses 
      evolved in both survivors and non-survivors with severe disease, non-survivors 
      showed attenuated IgG responses, accompanied by compromised Fcɣ receptor binding and 
      Fc effector activity, pointing to deficient humoral development rather than 
      disease-enhancing humoral immunity. In contrast, individuals with moderate disease 
      exhibited delayed responses that ultimately matured. These data highlight distinct 
      humoral trajectories associated with resolution of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the need 
      for early functional humoral immunity.

AB  - To elucidate the role of Tau isoforms and post-translational modification (PTM) 
      stoichiometry in Alzheimer's disease (AD), we generated a high-resolution 
      quantitative proteomics map of 95 PTMs on multiple isoforms of Tau isolated from 
      postmortem human tissue from 49 AD and 42 control subjects. Although Tau PTM maps 
      reveal heterogeneity across subjects, a subset of PTMs display high occupancy and 
      frequency for AD, suggesting importance in disease. Unsupervised analyses indicate 
      that PTMs occur in an ordered manner, leading to Tau aggregation. The processive 
      addition and minimal set of PTMs associated with seeding activity was further 
      defined by analysis of size-fractionated Tau. To summarize, features in the Tau 
      protein critical for disease intervention at different stages of disease are 
      identified, including enrichment of 0N and 4R isoforms, underrepresentation of the C 
      terminus, an increase in negative charge in the proline-rich region (PRR), and a 
      decrease in positive charge in the microtubule binding domain (MBD).

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein variant D614G supplanted the ancestral virus 
      worldwide, reaching near fixation in a matter of months. Here we show that D614G was 
      more infectious than the ancestral form on human lung cells, colon cells, and on 
      cells rendered permissive by ectopic expression of human ACE2 or of ACE2 orthologs 
      from various mammals, including Chinese rufous horseshoe bat and Malayan pangolin. 
      D614G did not alter S protein synthesis, processing, or incorporation into 
      SARS-CoV-2 particles, but D614G affinity for ACE2 was reduced due to a faster 
      dissociation rate. Assessment of the S protein trimer by cryo-electron microscopy 
      showed that D614G disrupts an interprotomer contact and that the conformation is 
      shifted toward an ACE2 binding-competent state, which is modeled to be on pathway 
      for virion membrane fusion with target cells. Consistent with this more open 
      conformation, neutralization potency of antibodies targeting the S protein 
      receptor-binding domain was not attenuated.

AB  - KRAS mutations are among the most common genetic alterations in lung, colorectal, 
      and pancreatic cancers. Direct inhibition of KRAS oncoproteins has been a 
      long-standing pursuit in precision oncology, one established shortly after the 
      discovery of RAS mutations in human cancer cells nearly 40 years ago. Recent 
      advances in medicinal chemistry have established inhibitors targeting KRAS(G12C), a 
      mutation found in ∼13% of lung adenocarcinomas and, at a lower frequency, in other 
      cancers. Preclinical studies describing their discovery and mechanism of action, 
      coupled with emerging clinical data from patients treated with these drugs, have 
      sparked a renewed enthusiasm in the study of KRAS and its therapeutic potential. 
      Here, we discuss how these advances are reshaping the fundamental aspects of KRAS 
      oncoprotein biology and the strides being made toward improving patient outcomes in 
      the clinic.

AB  - Targeted protein degradation (TPD) refers to the use of small molecules to induce 
      ubiquitin-dependent degradation of proteins. TPD is of interest in drug development, 
      as it can address previously inaccessible targets. However, degrader discovery and 
      optimization remains an inefficient process due to a lack of understanding of the 
      relative importance of the key molecular events required to induce target 
      degradation. Here, we use chemo-proteomics to annotate the degradable kinome. Our 
      expansive dataset provides chemical leads for ∼200 kinases and demonstrates that the 
      current practice of starting from the highest potency binder is an ineffective 
      method for discovering active compounds. We develop multitargeted degraders to 
      answer fundamental questions about the ubiquitin proteasome system, uncovering that 
      kinase degradation is p97 dependent. This work will not only fuel kinase degrader 
      discovery, but also provides a blueprint for evaluating targeted degradation across 
      entire gene families to accelerate understanding of TPD beyond the kinome.

AB  - The 2020 Lasker Awards, a celebration of one of the most prestigious international 
      prizes given to individuals for extraordinary contributions to Basic and Clinical 
      Medical Research, Pubic Health, and Special Achievement, was cancelled because of 
      the COVID-19 pandemic. Typically, essays on the awardees and their scientific and 
      medical contributions are solicited and published in Cell in collaboration with the 
      Lasker Committee. This year, the Lasker Committee commissioned an essay to reflect 
      on the historic contributions that scientists and physicians have made to our 
      understanding of immunology and virology, and future directions in medical and basic 
      research that have been highlighted by COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are the most frequent cause of 
      familial Parkinson's disease. LRRK2 is a multi-domain protein containing a kinase 
      and GTPase. Using correlative light and electron microscopy, in situ cryo-electron 
      tomography, and subtomogram analysis, we reveal a 14-Å structure of LRRK2 bearing a 
      pathogenic mutation that oligomerizes as a right-handed double helix around 
      microtubules, which are left-handed. Using integrative modeling, we determine the 
      architecture of LRRK2, showing that the GTPase and kinase are in close proximity, 
      with the GTPase closer to the microtubule surface, whereas the kinase is exposed to 
      the cytoplasm. We identify two oligomerization interfaces mediated by non-catalytic 
      domains. Mutation of one of these abolishes LRRK2 microtubule-association. Our work 
      demonstrates the power of cryo-electron tomography to generate models of previously 
      unsolved structures in their cellular environment.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has led to extensive morbidity and mortality throughout the 
      world. Clinical features that drive SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in humans include 
      inflammation and thrombosis, but the mechanistic details underlying these processes 
      remain to be determined. In this study, we demonstrate endothelial disruption and 
      vascular thrombosis in histopathologic sections of lungs from both humans and rhesus 
      macaques infected with SARS-CoV-2. To define key molecular pathways associated with 
      SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis in macaques, we performed transcriptomic analyses of 
      bronchoalveolar lavage and peripheral blood and proteomic analyses of serum. We 
      observed macrophage infiltrates in lung and upregulation of macrophage, complement, 
      platelet activation, thrombosis, and proinflammatory markers, including C-reactive 
      protein, MX1, IL-6, IL-1, IL-8, TNFα, and NF-κB. These results suggest a model in 
      which critical interactions between inflammatory and thrombosis pathways lead to 
      SARS-CoV-2-induced vascular disease. Our findings suggest potential therapeutic 
      targets for COVID-19.

AB  - Throughout a 24-h period, the small intestine (SI) is exposed to diurnally varying 
      food- and microbiome-derived antigenic burdens but maintains a strict immune 
      homeostasis, which when perturbed in genetically susceptible individuals, may lead 
      to Crohn disease. Herein, we demonstrate that dietary content and rhythmicity 
      regulate the diurnally shifting SI epithelial cell (SIEC) transcriptional landscape 
      through modulation of the SI microbiome. We exemplify this concept with SIEC major 
      histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, which is diurnally modulated by distinct 
      mucosal-adherent SI commensals, while supporting downstream diurnal activity of 
      intra-epithelial IL-10(+) lymphocytes regulating the SI barrier function. Disruption 
      of this diurnally regulated diet-microbiome-MHC class II-IL-10-epithelial barrier 
      axis by circadian clock disarrangement, alterations in feeding time or content, or 
      epithelial-specific MHC class II depletion leads to an extensive microbial product 
      influx, driving Crohn-like enteritis. Collectively, we highlight nutritional 
      features that modulate SI microbiome, immunity, and barrier function and identify 
      dietary, epithelial, and immune checkpoints along this axis to be potentially 
      exploitable in future Crohn disease interventions.

AB  - Long-term severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) shedding was 
      observed from the upper respiratory tract of a female immunocompromised individual 
      with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acquired hypogammaglobulinemia. Shedding of 
      infectious SARS-CoV-2 was observed up to 70 days, and of genomic and subgenomic RNA 
      up to 105 days, after initial diagnosis. The infection was not cleared after the 
      first treatment with convalescent plasma, suggesting a limited effect on SARS-CoV-2 
      in the upper respiratory tract of this individual. Several weeks after a second 
      convalescent plasma transfusion, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was no longer detected. We observed 
      marked within-host genomic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 with continuous turnover of 
      dominant viral variants. However, replication kinetics in Vero E6 cells and primary 
      human alveolar epithelial tissues were not affected. Our data indicate that certain 
      immunocompromised individuals may shed infectious virus longer than previously 
      recognized. Detection of subgenomic RNA is recommended in persistently 
      SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals as a proxy for shedding of infectious virus.

AB  - The U.S. government has sought to restrict immigration under the "America First" 
      doctrine. These policies severely harm American science by stripping it of talent 
      and eliminating a major driver of its innovation engine. We urge scientists to work 
      to reverse these policies and forcefully condemn anti-immigrant sentiments.

AB  - 2021 marks the 30th anniversary of the revelation that cyclosporin A and FK506 act 
      in a way previously not seen-as "molecular glues" that induce neo-protein-protein

AB  - Immunological memory is required for protection against repeated infections and is 
      the basis of all effective vaccines. Antibodies produced by memory B cells play an 
      essential role in many of these responses. We have combined lineage tracing with 
      antibody cloning from single B cells to examine the role of affinity in B cell 
      selection into germinal centers (GCs) and the memory B cell compartment in mice 
      immunized with an HIV-1 antigen. We find that contemporaneously developing memory 
      and GC B cells differ in their affinity for antigen throughout the immune response. 
      Whereas GC cells and their precursors are enriched in antigen binding, memory B 
      cells are not. Thus, the polyclonal memory B cell compartment is composed of B cells 
      that were activated during the immune response but whose antigen binding affinity 
      failed to support further clonal expansion in the GC.

AB  - Early embryogenesis is a conserved and self-organized process. In the mammalian 
      embryo, the potential for self-organization is manifested in its extraordinary 
      developmental plasticity, allowing a correctly patterned embryo to arise despite 
      experimental perturbation. The underlying mechanisms enabling such regulative 
      development have long been a topic of study. In this Review, we summarize our 
      current understanding of the self-organizing principles behind the regulative nature 
      of the early mammalian embryo. We argue that geometrical constraints, feedback 
      between mechanical and biochemical factors, and cellular heterogeneity are all 
      required to ensure the developmental plasticity of mammalian embryo development.

AB  - The ability to record transient cellular events in the DNA or RNA of cells would 
      enable precise, large-scale analysis, selection, and reprogramming of heterogeneous 
      cell populations. Here, we report a molecular technology for stable genetic tagging 
      of cells that exhibit activity-related increases in intracellular calcium 
      concentration (FLiCRE). We used FLiCRE to transcriptionally label activated neural 
      ensembles in the nucleus accumbens of the mouse brain during brief stimulation of 
      aversive inputs. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we detected FLiCRE transcripts 
      among the endogenous transcriptome, providing simultaneous readout of both cell-type 
      and calcium activation history. We identified a cell type in the nucleus accumbens 
      activated downstream of long-range excitatory projections. Taking advantage of 
      FLiCRE's modular design, we expressed an optogenetic channel selectively in this 
      cell type and showed that direct recruitment of this otherwise genetically 
      inaccessible population elicits behavioral aversion. The specificity and minute 
      resolution of FLiCRE enables molecularly informed characterization, manipulation, 
      and reprogramming of activated cellular ensembles.

AB  - The cellular complexity and scale of the early liver have constrained analyses 
      examining its emergence during organogenesis. To circumvent these issues, we 
      analyzed 45,334 single-cell transcriptomes from embryonic day (E)7.5, when endoderm 
      progenitors are specified, to E10.5 liver, when liver parenchymal and 
      non-parenchymal cell lineages emerge. Our data detail divergence of vascular and 
      sinusoidal endothelia, including a distinct transcriptional profile for sinusoidal 
      endothelial specification by E8.75. We characterize two distinct mesothelial cell 
      types as well as early hepatic stellate cells and reveal distinct spatiotemporal 
      distributions for these populations. We capture transcriptional profiles for 
      hepatoblast specification and migration, including the emergence of a 
      hepatomesenchymal cell type and evidence for hepatoblast collective cell migration. 
      Further, we identify cell-cell interactions during the organization of the primitive 
      sinusoid. This study provides a comprehensive atlas of liver lineage establishment 
      from the endoderm and mesoderm through to the organization of the primitive sinusoid 
      at single-cell resolution.

AB  - It is unclear how disease mutations impact intrinsically disordered protein regions 
      (IDRs), which lack a stable folded structure. These mutations, while prevalent in 
      disease, are frequently neglected or annotated as variants of unknown significance. 
      Biomolecular phase separation, a physical process often mediated by IDRs, has 
      increasingly appreciated roles in cellular organization and regulation. We find that 
      autism spectrum disorder (ASD)- and cancer-associated proteins are enriched for 
      predicted phase separation propensities, suggesting that IDR mutations disrupt phase 
      separation in key cellular processes. More generally, we hypothesize that 
      combinations of small-effect IDR mutations perturb phase separation, potentially 
      contributing to "missing heritability" in complex disease susceptibility.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 infection causes more severe disease in pregnant women compared to 
      age-matched non-pregnant women. Whether maternal infection causes changes in the 
      transfer of immunity to infants remains unclear. Maternal infections have previously 
      been associated with compromised placental antibody transfer, but the mechanism 
      underlying this compromised transfer is not established. Here, we used systems 
      serology to characterize the Fc profile of influenza-, pertussis-, and 
      SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies transferred across the placenta. Influenza- and 
      pertussis-specific antibodies were actively transferred. However, 
      SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody transfer was significantly reduced compared to 
      influenza- and pertussis-specific antibodies, and cord titers and functional 
      activity were lower than in maternal plasma. This effect was only observed in 
      third-trimester infection. SARS-CoV-2-specific transfer was linked to altered 
      SARS-CoV-2-antibody glycosylation profiles and was partially rescued by 
      infection-induced increases in IgG and increased FCGR3A placental expression. These 
      results point to unexpected compensatory mechanisms to boost immunity in neonates, 
      providing insights for maternal vaccine design.

AB  - The 3D organization of chromatin regulates many genome functions. Our understanding 
      of 3D genome organization requires tools to directly visualize chromatin 
      conformation in its native context. Here we report an imaging technology for 
      visualizing chromatin organization across multiple scales in single cells with high 
      genomic throughput. First we demonstrate multiplexed imaging of hundreds of genomic 
      loci by sequential hybridization, which allows high-resolution conformation tracing 
      of whole chromosomes. Next we report a multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ 
      hybridization (MERFISH)-based method for genome-scale chromatin tracing and 
      demonstrate simultaneous imaging of more than 1,000 genomic loci and nascent 
      transcripts of more than 1,000 genes together with landmark nuclear structures. 
      Using this technology, we characterize chromatin domains, compartments, and 
      trans-chromosomal interactions and their relationship to transcription in single 
      cells. We envision broad application of this high-throughput, multi-scale, and 
      multi-modal imaging technology, which provides an integrated view of chromatin 
      organization in its native structural and functional context.

AB  - Gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine neoplasm (NEN) that consists of 
      neuroendocrine tumor and neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) is a lethal but 
      under-investigated disease owing to its rarity. To fill the scarcity of clinically 
      relevant models of GEP-NEN, we here established 25 lines of NEN organoids and 
      performed their comprehensive molecular characterization. GEP-NEN organoids 
      recapitulated pathohistological and functional phenotypes of the original tumors. 
      Whole-genome sequencing revealed frequent genetic alterations in TP53 and RB1 in 
      GEP-NECs, and characteristic chromosome-wide loss of heterozygosity in GEP-NENs. 
      Transcriptome analysis identified molecular subtypes that are distinguished by the 
      expression of distinct transcription factors. GEP-NEN organoids gained independence 
      from the stem cell niche irrespective of genetic mutations. Compound knockout of 
      TP53 and RB1, together with overexpression of key transcription factors, conferred 
      on the normal colonic epithelium phenotypes that are compatible with GEP-NEN 
      biology. Altogether, our study not only provides genetic understanding of GEP-NEN, 
      but also connects its genetics and biological phenotypes.

AB  - A safe, effective, and scalable vaccine is needed to halt the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 
      pandemic. We describe the structure-based design of self-assembling protein 
      nanoparticle immunogens that elicit potent and protective antibody responses against 
      SARS-CoV-2 in mice. The nanoparticle vaccines display 60 SARS-CoV-2 spike 
      receptor-binding domains (RBDs) in a highly immunogenic array and induce 
      neutralizing antibody titers 10-fold higher than the prefusion-stabilized spike 
      despite a 5-fold lower dose. Antibodies elicited by the RBD nanoparticles target 
      multiple distinct epitopes, suggesting they may not be easily susceptible to escape 
      mutations, and exhibit a lower binding:neutralizing ratio than convalescent human 
      sera, which may minimize the risk of vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory 
      disease. The high yield and stability of the assembled nanoparticles suggest that 
      manufacture of the nanoparticle vaccines will be highly scalable. These results 
      highlight the utility of robust antigen display platforms and have launched cGMP 
      manufacturing efforts to advance the SARS-CoV-2-RBD nanoparticle vaccine into the 
      clinic.

AB  - Antibodies are key immune effectors that confer protection against pathogenic 
      threats. The nature and longevity of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection 
      are not well defined. We charted longitudinal antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in 92 
      subjects after symptomatic COVID-19. Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 are unimodally 
      distributed over a broad range, with symptom severity correlating directly with 
      virus-specific antibody magnitude. Seventy-six subjects followed longitudinally to 
      ∼100 days demonstrated marked heterogeneity in antibody duration dynamics. 
      Virus-specific IgG decayed substantially in most individuals, whereas a distinct 
      subset had stable or increasing antibody levels in the same time frame despite 
      similar initial antibody magnitudes. These individuals with increasing responses 
      recovered rapidly from symptomatic COVID-19 disease, harbored increased somatic 
      mutations in virus-specific memory B cell antibody genes, and had persistent higher 
      frequencies of previously activated CD4(+) T cells. These findings illuminate an 
      efficient immune phenotype that connects symptom clearance speed to differential 
      antibody durability dynamics.

AB  - RNA viruses are among the most prevalent pathogens and are a major burden on 
      society. Although RNA viruses have been studied extensively, little is known about 
      the processes that occur during the first several hours of infection because of a 
      lack of sensitive assays. Here we develop a single-molecule imaging assay, virus 
      infection real-time imaging (VIRIM), to study translation and replication of 
      individual RNA viruses in live cells. VIRIM uncovered a striking heterogeneity in 
      replication dynamics between cells and revealed extensive coordination between 
      translation and replication of single viral RNAs. Furthermore, using VIRIM, we 
      identify the replication step of the incoming viral RNA as a major bottleneck of 
      successful infection and identify host genes that are responsible for inhibition of 
      early virus replication. Single-molecule imaging of virus infection is a powerful 
      tool to study virus replication and virus-host interactions that may be broadly 
      applicable to RNA viruses.

AB  - The hippocampus is crucial for spatial navigation and episodic memory formation. 
      Hippocampal place cells exhibit spatially selective activity within an environment 
      and have been proposed to form the neural basis of a cognitive map of space that 
      supports these mnemonic functions. However, the direct influence of place cell 
      activity on spatial navigation behavior has not yet been demonstrated. Using an 
      'all-optical' combination of simultaneous two-photon calcium imaging and two-photon 
      optogenetics, we identified and selectively activated place cells that encoded 
      behaviorally relevant locations in a virtual reality environment. Targeted 
      stimulation of a small number of place cells was sufficient to bias the behavior of 
      animals during a spatial memory task, providing causal evidence that hippocampal 
      place cells actively support spatial navigation and memory.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has claimed the lives of over one 
      million people worldwide. The causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a member of the Coronaviridae family of viruses that 
      can cause respiratory infections of varying severity. The cellular host factors and 
      pathways co-opted during SARS-CoV-2 and related coronavirus life cycles remain ill 
      defined. To address this gap, we performed genome-scale CRISPR knockout screens 
      during infection by SARS-CoV-2 and three seasonal coronaviruses (HCoV-OC43, 
      HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E). These screens uncovered host factors and pathways with 
      pan-coronavirus and virus-specific functional roles, including major dependency on 
      glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis, sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) 
      signaling, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, and 
      glycosylphosphatidylinositol biosynthesis, as well as a requirement for several 
      poorly characterized proteins. We identified an absolute requirement for the VMP1, 
      TMEM41, and TMEM64 (VTT) domain-containing protein transmembrane protein 41B 
      (TMEM41B) for infection by SARS-CoV-2 and three seasonal coronaviruses. This human

AB  - Given the heterogeneity of senescent cells, our knowledge of both the drivers and 
      consequences of cellular senescence in tissues and organs remains limited, as is our 
      understanding of how this process could be harnessed for human health. Here we 
      identified five broad areas that would help propel the field forward.

AB  - We propose that the teratoma, a recognized standard for validating pluripotency in 
      stem cells, could be a promising platform for studying human developmental 
      processes. Performing single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of 179,632 cells across 
      23 teratomas from 4 cell lines, we found that teratomas reproducibly contain 
      approximately 20 cell types across all 3 germ layers, that inter-teratoma cell type 
      heterogeneity is comparable with organoid systems, and teratoma gut and brain cell 
      types correspond well to similar fetal cell types. Furthermore, cellular barcoding 
      confirmed that injected stem cells robustly engraft and contribute to all lineages. 
      Using pooled CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens, we showed that teratomas can enable 
      simultaneous assaying of the effects of genetic perturbations across all germ 
      layers. Additionally, we demonstrated that teratomas can be sculpted molecularly via 
      microRNA (miRNA)-regulated suicide gene expression to enrich for specific tissues. 
      Taken together, teratomas are a promising platform for modeling multi-lineage 
      development, pan-tissue functional genetic screening, and tissue engineering.

AB  - A greater understanding of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) regulation is required for 
      dissecting protective versus detrimental immunity to pathogens that cause chronic 
      infections such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). We have shown that systemic 
      administration of Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) or β-glucan reprograms HSCs in the 
      bone marrow (BM) via a type II interferon (IFN-II) or interleukin-1 (IL1) response, 
      respectively, which confers protective trained immunity against Mtb. Here, we 
      demonstrate that, unlike BCG or β-glucan, Mtb reprograms HSCs via an IFN-I response 
      that suppresses myelopoiesis and impairs development of protective trained immunity 
      to Mtb. Mechanistically, IFN-I signaling dysregulates iron metabolism, depolarizes 
      mitochondrial membrane potential, and induces cell death specifically in myeloid 
      progenitors. Additionally, activation of the IFN-I/iron axis in HSCs impairs trained 
      immunity to Mtb infection. These results identify an unanticipated immune evasion 
      strategy of Mtb in the BM that controls the magnitude and intrinsic 
      anti-microbial capacity of innate immunity to infection.

AB  - Repetitive elements (REs) compose ∼50% of the human genome and are normally 
      transcriptionally silenced, although the mechanism has remained elusive. Through an 
      RNAi screen, we identified FBXO44 as an essential repressor of REs in cancer cells. 
      FBXO44 bound H3K9me3-modified nucleosomes at the replication fork and recruited 
      SUV39H1, CRL4, and Mi-2/NuRD to transcriptionally silence REs post-DNA replication. 
      FBXO44/SUV39H1 inhibition reactivated REs, leading to DNA replication stress and 
      stimulation of MAVS/STING antiviral pathways and interferon (IFN) signaling in 
      cancer cells to promote decreased tumorigenicity, increased immunogenicity, and 
      enhanced immunotherapy response. FBXO44 expression inversely correlated with 
      replication stress, antiviral pathways, IFN signaling, and cytotoxic T cell 
      infiltration in human cancers, while a FBXO44-immune gene signature correlated with 
      improved immunotherapy response in cancer patients. FBXO44/SUV39H1 were dispensable 
      in normal cells. Collectively, FBXO44/SUV39H1 are crucial repressors of RE 
      transcription, and their inhibition selectively induces DNA replication stress and 
      viral mimicry in cancer cells.

AB  - Metazoan organisms rely on conserved stress response pathways to alleviate adverse 
      conditions and preserve cellular integrity. Stress responses are particularly 
      important in stem cells that provide lifetime support for tissue formation and 
      repair, but how these protective systems are integrated into developmental programs 
      is poorly understood. Here we used myoblast differentiation to identify the E3 
      ligase CUL2(FEM1B) and its substrate FNIP1 as core components of the reductive 
      stress response. Reductive stress, as caused by prolonged antioxidant signaling or 
      mitochondrial inactivity, reverts the oxidation of invariant Cys residues in FNIP1 
      and allows CUL2(FEM1B) to recognize its target. The ensuing proteasomal degradation 
      of FNIP1 restores mitochondrial activity to preserve redox homeostasis and stem cell 
      integrity. The reductive stress response is therefore built around a 
      ubiquitin-dependent rheostat that tunes mitochondrial activity to redox needs and 
      implicates metabolic control in coordination of stress and developmental signaling.

AB  - Cellular stress leads to reprogramming of mRNA translation and formation of stress 
      granules (SGs), membraneless organelles consisting of mRNA and RNA-binding proteins. 
      Although the function of SGs remains largely unknown, it is widely assumed they 
      contain exclusively non-translating mRNA. Here, we re-examine this hypothesis using 
      single-molecule imaging of mRNA translation in living cells. Although we observe 
      non-translating mRNAs are preferentially recruited to SGs, we find unequivocal 
      evidence that mRNAs localized to SGs can undergo translation. Our data indicate that 
      SG-associated translation is not rare, and the entire translation cycle (initiation, 
      elongation, and termination) can occur on SG-localized transcripts. Furthermore, 
      translating mRNAs can be observed transitioning between the cytosol and SGs without 
      changing their translational status. Together, these results demonstrate that mRNA 
      localization to SGs is compatible with translation and argue against a direct role 
      for SGs in inhibition of protein synthesis.

AB  - In response to skeletal muscle contraction during exercise, paracrine factors 
      coordinate tissue remodeling, which underlies this healthy adaptation. Here we 
      describe a pH-sensing metabolite signal that initiates muscle remodeling upon 
      exercise. In mice and humans, exercising skeletal muscle releases the mitochondrial 
      metabolite succinate into the local interstitium and circulation. Selective 
      secretion of succinate is facilitated by its transient protonation, which occurs 
      upon muscle cell acidification. In the protonated monocarboxylic form, succinate is 
      rendered a transport substrate for monocarboxylate transporter 1, which facilitates 
      pH-gated release. Upon secretion, succinate signals via its cognate receptor SUCNR1 
      in non-myofibrillar cells in muscle tissue to control muscle-remodeling 
      transcriptional programs. This succinate-SUCNR1 signaling is required for paracrine 
      regulation of muscle innervation, muscle matrix remodeling, and muscle strength in 
      response to exercise training. In sum, we define a bioenergetic sensor in muscle 
      that utilizes intracellular pH and succinate to coordinate tissue adaptation to 
      exercise.

AB  - Thousands of proteins localize to the nucleus; however, it remains unclear which 
      contain transcriptional effectors. Here, we develop HT-recruit, a pooled assay where 
      protein libraries are recruited to a reporter, and their transcriptional effects are 
      measured by sequencing. Using this approach, we measure gene silencing and 
      activation for thousands of domains. We find a relationship between repressor 
      function and evolutionary age for the KRAB domains, discover that Homeodomain 
      repressor strength is collinear with Hox genetic organization, and identify 
      activities for several domains of unknown function. Deep mutational scanning of the 
      CRISPRi KRAB maps the co-repressor binding surface and identifies substitutions that 
      improve stability/silencing. By tiling 238 proteins, we find repressors as short as 
      ten amino acids. Finally, we report new activator domains, including a divergent 
      KRAB. These results provide a resource of 600 human proteins containing effectors 
      and demonstrate a scalable strategy for assigning functions to protein domains.

AB  - Infants born by vaginal delivery are colonized with maternal fecal microbes. 
      Cesarean section (CS) birth disturbs mother-to-neonate transmission. In this study 
      (NCT03568734), we evaluated whether disturbed intestinal microbiota development 
      could be restored in term CS-born infants by postnatal, orally delivered fecal 
      microbiota transplantation (FMT). We recruited 17 mothers, of whom seven were 
      selected after careful screening. Their infants received a diluted fecal sample from 
      their own mothers, taken 3 weeks prior to delivery. All seven infants had an 
      uneventful clinical course during the 3-month follow-up and showed no adverse 
      effects. The temporal development of the fecal microbiota composition of FMT-treated 
      CS-born infants no longer resembled that of untreated CS-born infants but showed 
      significant similarity to that of vaginally born infants. This proof-of-concept 
      study demonstrates that the intestinal microbiota of CS-born infants can be restored 
      postnatally by maternal FMT. However, this should only be done after careful 
      clinical and microbiological screening.

AB  - Correction of disease-causing mutations in human embryos holds the potential to 
      reduce the burden of inherited genetic disorders and improve fertility treatments 
      for couples with disease-causing mutations in lieu of embryo selection. Here, we 
      evaluate repair outcomes of a Cas9-induced double-strand break (DSB) introduced on 
      the paternal chromosome at the EYS locus, which carries a frameshift mutation 
      causing blindness. We show that the most common repair outcome is 
      microhomology-mediated end joining, which occurs during the first cell cycle in the 
      zygote, leading to embryos with non-mosaic restoration of the reading frame. 
      Notably, about half of the breaks remain unrepaired, resulting in an undetectable 
      paternal allele and, after mitosis, loss of one or both chromosomal arms. 
      Correspondingly, Cas9 off-target cleavage results in chromosomal losses and 
      hemizygous indels because of cleavage of both alleles. These results demonstrate the 
      ability to manipulate chromosome content and reveal significant challenges for 
      mutation correction in human embryos.

AB  - Mg(2+) is the most abundant divalent cation in metazoans and an essential cofactor 
      for ATP, nucleic acids, and countless metabolic enzymes. To understand how the 
      spatio-temporal dynamics of intracellular Mg(2+) ((i)Mg(2+)) are integrated into 
      cellular signaling, we implemented a comprehensive screen to discover regulators of 
      (i)Mg(2+) dynamics. Lactate emerged as an activator of rapid release of Mg(2+) from 
      endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores, which facilitates mitochondrial Mg(2+) 
      ((m)Mg(2+)) uptake in multiple cell types. We demonstrate that this process is 
      remarkably temperature sensitive and mediated through intracellular but not 
      extracellular signals. The ER-mitochondrial Mg(2+) dynamics is selectively 
      stimulated by L-lactate. Further, we show that lactate-mediated (m)Mg(2+) entry is 
      facilitated by Mrs2, and point mutations in the intermembrane space loop limits 
      (m)Mg(2+) uptake. Intriguingly, suppression of (m)Mg(2+) surge alleviates 
      inflammation-induced multi-organ failure. Together, these findings reveal that 
      lactate mobilizes (i)Mg(2+) and links the (m)Mg(2+) transport machinery with major 
      metabolic feedback circuits and mitochondrial bioenergetics.

AB  - Binding of arrestin to phosphorylated G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) controls 
      many aspects of cell signaling. The number and arrangement of phosphates may vary 
      substantially for a given GPCR, and different phosphorylation patterns trigger 
      different arrestin-mediated effects. Here, we determine how GPCR phosphorylation 
      influences arrestin behavior by using atomic-level simulations and site-directed 
      spectroscopy to reveal the effects of phosphorylation patterns on arrestin binding 
      and conformation. We find that patterns favoring binding differ from those favoring 
      activation-associated conformational change. Both binding and conformation depend 
      more on arrangement of phosphates than on their total number, with phosphorylation 
      at different positions sometimes exerting opposite effects. Phosphorylation patterns 
      selectively favor a wide variety of arrestin conformations, differently affecting 
      arrestin sites implicated in scaffolding distinct signaling proteins. We also reveal 
      molecular mechanisms of these phenomena. Our work reveals the structural basis for 
      the long-standing "barcode" hypothesis and has important implications for design of 
      functionally selective GPCR-targeted drugs.

AB  - Mammalian SWI/SNF complexes are ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes that 
      regulate genomic architecture. Here, we present a structural model of the 
      endogenously purified human canonical BAF complex bound to the nucleosome, generated 
      using cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), cross-linking mass spectrometry, and 
      homology modeling. BAF complexes bilaterally engage the nucleosome H2A/H2B acidic 
      patch regions through the SMARCB1 C-terminal α-helix and the SMARCA4/2 C-terminal 
      SnAc/post-SnAc regions, with disease-associated mutations in either causing 
      attenuated chromatin remodeling activities. Further, we define changes in BAF 
      complex architecture upon nucleosome engagement and compare the structural model of 
      endogenous BAF to those of related SWI/SNF-family complexes. Finally, we assign and 
      experimentally interrogate cancer-associated hot-spot mutations localizing within 
      the endogenous human BAF complex, identifying those that disrupt BAF subunit-subunit 
      and subunit-nucleosome interfaces in the nucleosome-bound conformation. Taken 
      together, this integrative structural approach provides important biophysical 
      foundations for understanding the mechanisms of BAF complex function in normal and 
      disease states.

AB  - Plasmodium species, the causative agent of malaria, rely on glucose for energy 
      supply during blood stage. Inhibition of glucose uptake thus represents a potential 
      strategy for the development of antimalarial drugs. Here, we present the crystal 
      structures of PfHT1, the sole hexose transporter in the genome of Plasmodium 
      species, at resolutions of 2.6 Å in complex with D-glucose and 3.7 Å with a 
      moderately selective inhibitor, C3361. Although both structures exhibit occluded 
      conformations, binding of C3361 induces marked rearrangements that result in an 
      additional pocket. This inhibitor-binding-induced pocket presents an opportunity for 
      the rational design of PfHT1-specific inhibitors. Among our designed C3361 
      derivatives, several exhibited improved inhibition of PfHT1 and cellular potency 
      against P. falciparum, with excellent selectivity to human GLUT1. These findings 
      serve as a proof of concept for the development of the next-generation antimalarial 
      chemotherapeutics by simultaneously targeting the orthosteric and allosteric sites 
      of PfHT1.

AB  - Despite considerable efforts, the mechanisms linking genomic alterations to the 
      transcriptional identity of cancer cells remain elusive. Integrative genomic 
      analysis, using a network-based approach, identified 407 master regulator (MR) 
      proteins responsible for canalizing the genetics of individual samples from 20 
      cohorts in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) into 112 transcriptionally distinct tumor 
      subtypes. MR proteins could be further organized into 24 pan-cancer, master 
      regulator block modules (MRBs), each regulating key cancer hallmarks and predictive 
      of patient outcome in multiple cohorts. Of all somatic alterations detected in each 
      individual sample, >50% were predicted to induce aberrant MR activity, yielding 
      insight into mechanisms linking tumor genetics and transcriptional identity and 
      establishing non-oncogene dependencies. Genetic and pharmacological validation 
      assays confirmed the predicted effect of upstream mutations and MR activity on 
      downstream cellular identity and phenotype. Thus, co-analysis of mutational and gene 
      expression profiles identified elusive subtypes and provided testable hypothesis for 
      mechanisms mediating the effect of genetic alterations.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the 2019-2020 pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 genome 
      is replicated and transcribed by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase holoenzyme 
      (subunits nsp7/nsp8(2)/nsp12) along with a cast of accessory factors. One of these 
      factors is the nsp13 helicase. Both the holo-RdRp and nsp13 are essential for viral 
      replication and are targets for treating the disease COVID-19. Here we present 
      cryoelectron microscopic structures of the SARS-CoV-2 holo-RdRp with an RNA template 
      product in complex with two molecules of the nsp13 helicase. The Nidovirales 
      order-specific N-terminal domains of each nsp13 interact with the N-terminal 
      extension of each copy of nsp8. One nsp13 also contacts the nsp12 thumb. The 
      structure places the nucleic acid-binding ATPase domains of the helicase directly in 
      front of the replicating-transcribing holo-RdRp, constraining models for nsp13 
      function. We also observe ADP-Mg(2+) bound in the nsp12 N-terminal nidovirus 
      RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase domain, detailing a new pocket for anti-viral 
      therapy development.

      through Cxcl10.

AB  - Brain metastasis (br-met) develops in an immunologically unique br-met niche. 
      Central nervous system-native myeloid cells (CNS-myeloids) and bone-marrow-derived 
      myeloid cells (BMDMs) cooperatively regulate brain immunity. The phenotypic 
      heterogeneity and specific roles of these myeloid subsets in shaping the br-met 
      niche to regulate br-met outgrowth have not been fully revealed. Applying multimodal 
      single-cell analyses, we elucidated a heterogeneous but spatially defined 
      CNS-myeloid response during br-met outgrowth. We found Ccr2(+) BMDMs minimally 
      influenced br-met while CNS-myeloid promoted br-met outgrowth. Additionally, 
      br-met-associated CNS-myeloid exhibited downregulation of Cx3cr1. Cx3cr1 knockout in 
      CNS-myeloid increased br-met incidence, leading to an enriched interferon response 
      signature and Cxcl10 upregulation. Significantly, neutralization of Cxcl10 reduced 
      br-met, while rCxcl10 increased br-met and recruited VISTA(Hi) PD-L1(+) CNS-myeloid 
      to br-met lesions. Inhibiting VISTA- and PD-L1-signaling relieved immune suppression 
      and reduced br-met burden. Our results demonstrate that loss of Cx3cr1 in 
      CNS-myeloid triggers a Cxcl10-mediated vicious cycle, cultivating a 
      br-met-promoting, immune-suppressive niche.

AB  - A mysterious feature of Crohn's disease (CD) is the extra-intestinal manifestation 
      of "creeping fat" (CrF), defined as expansion of mesenteric adipose tissue around 
      the inflamed and fibrotic intestine. In the current study, we explore whether 
      microbial translocation in CD serves as a central cue for CrF development. We 
      discovered a subset of mucosal-associated gut bacteria that consistently 
      translocated and remained viable in CrF in CD ileal surgical resections, and 
      identified Clostridium innocuum as a signature of this consortium with strain 
      variation between mucosal and adipose isolates, suggesting preference for lipid-rich 
      environments. Single-cell RNA sequencing characterized CrF as both pro-fibrotic and 
      pro-adipogenic with a rich milieu of activated immune cells responding to microbial 
      stimuli, which we confirm in gnotobiotic mice colonized with C. innocuum. Ex vivo 
      validation of expression patterns suggests C. innocuum stimulates tissue remodeling 
      via M2 macrophages, leading to an adipose tissue barrier that serves to prevent 
      systemic dissemination of bacteria.

AB  - The association of nuclear DNA with histones to form chromatin is essential for 
      temporal and spatial control of eukaryotic genomes. In this study, we examined the 
      physical state of condensed chromatin in vitro and in vivo. Our in vitro studies 
      demonstrate that self-association of nucleosomal arrays under a wide range of 
      solution conditions produces supramolecular condensates in which the chromatin is 
      physically constrained and solid-like. By measuring DNA mobility in living cells, we 
      show that condensed chromatin also exhibits solid-like behavior in vivo. 
      Representative heterochromatin proteins, however, display liquid-like behavior and 
      coalesce around the solid chromatin scaffold. Importantly, euchromatin and 
      heterochromatin show solid-like behavior even under conditions that produce limited 
      interactions between chromatin fibers. Our results reveal that condensed chromatin 
      exists in a solid-like state whose properties resist external forces and create an 
      elastic gel and provides a scaffold that supports liquid-liquid phase separation of 
      chromatin binding proteins.

AB  - Food is simultaneously a source of essential nutrients and a potential source of 
      lethal toxins and pathogens. Consequently, multiple sensory mechanisms evolved to 
      monitor the quality of food based on the presence and relative abundance of 
      beneficial and harmful food substances. These include the olfactory, gustatory, and 
      gut chemosensory systems. Here we argue that, in addition to these systems, allergic 
      immunity plays a role in food quality control by mounting allergic defenses against 
      food antigens associated with noxious substances. Exaggeration of these defenses can 
      result in pathological food allergy.

AB  - Barrier tissue immune responses are regulated in part by nociceptors. Nociceptor 
      ablation alters local immune responses at peripheral sites and within draining lymph 
      nodes (LNs). The mechanisms and significance of nociceptor-dependent modulation of 
      LN function are unknown. Using high-resolution imaging, viral tracing, single-cell 
      transcriptomics, and optogenetics, we identified and functionally tested a sensory 
      neuro-immune circuit that is responsive to lymph-borne inflammatory signals. 
      Transcriptomics profiling revealed that multiple sensory neuron subsets, 
      predominantly peptidergic nociceptors, innervate LNs, distinct from those 
      innervating surrounding skin. To uncover LN-resident cells that may interact with 
      LN-innervating sensory neurons, we generated a LN single-cell transcriptomics atlas 
      and nominated nociceptor target populations and interaction modalities. Optogenetic 
      stimulation of LN-innervating sensory fibers triggered rapid transcriptional changes 
      in the predicted interacting cell types, particularly endothelium, stromal cells, 
      and innate leukocytes. Thus, a unique population of sensory neurons monitors 
      peripheral LNs and may locally regulate gene expression.

AB  - BCG vaccination in children protects against heterologous infections and improves 
      survival independently of tuberculosis prevention. The phase III ACTIVATE trial 
      assessed whether BCG has similar effects in the elderly. In this double-blind, 
      randomized trial, elderly patients (n = 198) received BCG or placebo vaccine at 
      hospital discharge and were followed for 12 months for new infections. At interim 
      analysis, BCG vaccination significantly increased the time to first infection 
      (median 16 weeks compared to 11 weeks after placebo). The incidence of new 
      infections was 42.3% (95% CIs 31.9%-53.4%) after placebo vaccination and 25.0% (95% 
      CIs 16.4%-36.1%) after BCG vaccination; most of the protection was against 
      respiratory tract infections of probable viral origin (hazard ratio 0.21, p = 
      0.013). No difference in the frequency of adverse effects was found. Data show that 
      BCG vaccination is safe and can protect the elderly against infections. Larger 
      studies are needed to assess protection against respiratory infections, including 
      COVID-19 (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03296423).

AB  - The colon is primarily responsible for absorbing fluids. It contains a large number 
      of microorganisms including fungi, which are enriched in its distal segment. The 
      colonic mucosa must therefore tightly regulate fluid influx to control absorption of 
      fungal metabolites, which can be toxic to epithelial cells and lead to barrier 
      dysfunction. How this is achieved remains unknown. Here, we describe a mechanism by 
      which the innate immune system allows rapid quality check of absorbed fluids to 
      avoid intoxication of colonocytes. This mechanism relies on a population of distal 
      colon macrophages that are equipped with "balloon-like" protrusions (BLPs) inserted 
      in the epithelium, which sample absorbed fluids. In the absence of macrophages or 
      BLPs, epithelial cells keep absorbing fluids containing fungal products, leading to 
      their death and subsequent loss of epithelial barrier integrity. These results 
      reveal an unexpected and essential role of macrophages in the maintenance of 
      colon-microbiota interactions in homeostasis. VIDEO ABSTRACT.

AB  - Endocannabinoids are host-derived lipid hormones that fundamentally impact 
      gastrointestinal (GI) biology. The use of cannabis and other exocannabinoids as 
      anecdotal treatments for various GI disorders inspired the search for mechanisms by 
      which these compounds mediate their effects, which led to the discovery of the 
      mammalian endocannabinoid system. Dysregulated endocannabinoid signaling was linked 
      to inflammation and the gut microbiota. However, the effects of endocannabinoids on 
      host susceptibility to infection has not been explored. Here, we show that mice with 
      elevated levels of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) are protected 
      from enteric infection by Enterobacteriaceae pathogens. 2-AG directly modulates 
      pathogen function by inhibiting virulence programs essential for successful 
      infection. Furthermore, 2-AG antagonizes the bacterial receptor QseC, a histidine 
      kinase encoded within the core Enterobacteriaceae genome that promotes the 
      activation of pathogen-associated type three secretion systems. Taken together, our 
      findings establish that endocannabinoids are directly sensed by bacteria and can 
      modulate bacterial function.

AB  - Development of γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) and modulators (GSMs) represents an 
      attractive therapeutic opportunity for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and cancers. 
      However, how these GSIs and GSMs target γ-secretase has remained largely unknown. 
      Here, we report the cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of human 
      γ-secretase bound individually to two GSI clinical candidates, Semagacestat and 
      Avagacestat, a transition state analog GSI L685,458, and a classic GSM E2012, at 
      overall resolutions of 2.6-3.1 Å. Remarkably, each of the GSIs occupies the same 
      general location on presenilin 1 (PS1) that accommodates the β strand from amyloid 
      precursor protein or Notch, interfering with substrate recruitment. L685,458 
      directly coordinates the two catalytic aspartate residues of PS1. E2012 binds to an 
      allosteric site of γ-secretase on the extracellular side, potentially explaining its 
      modulating activity. Structural analysis reveals a set of shared themes and 
      variations for inhibitor and modulator recognition that will guide development of 
      the next-generation substrate-selective inhibitors.

AB  - The control over the extent and timing of G protein signaling is provided by the 
      regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) proteins that deactivate G protein α subunits 
      (Gα). Mammalian genomes encode 20 canonical RGS and 16 Gα genes with key roles in 
      physiology and disease. To understand the principles governing the selectivity of Gα 
      regulation by RGS, we examine the catalytic activity of all canonical human RGS 
      proteins and their selectivity for a complete set of Gα substrates using real-time 
      kinetic measurements in living cells. The data reveal rules governing RGS-Gα 
      recognition, the structural basis of its selectivity, and provide principles for 
      engineering RGS proteins with defined selectivity. The study also explores the 
      evolution of RGS-Gα selectivity through ancestral reconstruction and demonstrates 
      how naturally occurring non-synonymous variants in RGS alter signaling. These 
      results provide a blueprint for decoding signaling selectivity and advance our 
      understanding of molecular recognition principles.

AB  - Neurons are frequently classified into distinct types on the basis of structural, 
      physiological, or genetic attributes. To better constrain the definition of neuronal 
      cell types, we characterized the transcriptomes and intrinsic physiological 
      properties of over 4,200 mouse visual cortical GABAergic interneurons and 
      reconstructed the local morphologies of 517 of those neurons. We find that most 
      transcriptomic types (t-types) occupy specific laminar positions within visual 
      cortex, and, for most types, the cells mapping to a t-type exhibit consistent 
      electrophysiological and morphological properties. These properties display both 
      discrete and continuous variation among t-types. Through multimodal integrated 
      analysis, we define 28 met-types that have congruent morphological, 
      electrophysiological, and transcriptomic properties and robust mutual 
      predictability. We identify layer-specific axon innervation pattern as a defining 
      feature distinguishing different met-types. These met-types represent a unified 
      definition of cortical GABAergic interneuron types, providing a systematic framework 
      to capture existing knowledge and bridge future analyses across different 
      modalities.

AB  - Hunger and thirst have distinct goals but control similar ingestive behaviors, and 
      little is known about neural processes that are shared between these behavioral 
      states. We identify glutamatergic neurons in the peri-locus coeruleus 
      (periLC(VGLUT2) neurons) as a polysynaptic convergence node from separate 
      energy-sensitive and hydration-sensitive cell populations. We develop methods for 
      stable hindbrain calcium imaging in free-moving mice, which show that periLC(VGLUT2) 
      neurons are tuned to ingestive behaviors and respond similarly to food or water 
      consumption. PeriLC(VGLUT2) neurons are scalably inhibited by palatability and 
      homeostatic need during consumption. Inhibition of periLC(VGLUT2) neurons is 
      rewarding and increases consumption by enhancing palatability and prolonging 
      ingestion duration. These properties comprise a double-negative feedback 
      relationship that sustains food or water consumption without affecting food- or 
      water-seeking. PeriLC(VGLUT2) neurons are a hub between hunger and thirst that 
      specifically controls motivation for food and water ingestion, which is a factor 
      that contributes to hedonic overeating and obesity.

TI  - HLA-DR15 Molecules Jointly Shape an Autoreactive T Cell Repertoire in Multiple 
      Sclerosis.

AB  - The HLA-DR15 haplotype is the strongest genetic risk factor for multiple sclerosis 
      (MS), but our understanding of how it contributes to MS is limited. Because 
      autoreactive CD4(+) T cells and B cells as antigen-presenting cells are involved in 
      MS pathogenesis, we characterized the immunopeptidomes of the two HLA-DR15 
      allomorphs DR2a and DR2b of human primary B cells and monocytes, thymus, and MS 
      brain tissue. Self-peptides from HLA-DR molecules, particularly from DR2a and DR2b 
      themselves, are abundant on B cells and thymic antigen-presenting cells. 
      Furthermore, we identified autoreactive CD4(+) T cell clones that can cross-react 
      with HLA-DR-derived self-peptides (HLA-DR-SPs), peptides from MS-associated foreign 
      agents (Epstein-Barr virus and Akkermansia muciniphila), and autoantigens presented 
      by DR2a and DR2b. Thus, both HLA-DR15 allomorphs jointly shape an autoreactive 
      T cell repertoire by serving as antigen-presenting structures and epitope sources 
      and by presenting the same foreign peptides and autoantigens to autoreactive CD4(+) 
      T cells in MS.

AB  - The fidelity of intracellular signaling hinges on the organization of dynamic 
      activity architectures. Spatial compartmentation was first proposed over 30 years 
      ago to explain how diverse G protein-coupled receptors achieve specificity despite 
      converging on a ubiquitous messenger, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). 
      However, the mechanisms responsible for spatially constraining this diffusible 
      messenger remain elusive. Here, we reveal that the type I regulatory subunit of 
      cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), RIα, undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation 
      (LLPS) as a function of cAMP signaling to form biomolecular condensates enriched in 
      cAMP and PKA activity, critical for effective cAMP compartmentation. We further show 
      that a PKA fusion oncoprotein associated with an atypical liver cancer potently 
      blocks RIα LLPS and induces aberrant cAMP signaling. Loss of RIα LLPS in normal 
      cells increases cell proliferation and induces cell transformation. Our work reveals 
      LLPS as a principal organizer of signaling compartments and highlights the 
      pathological consequences of dysregulating this activity architecture.

AB  - Serotonin plays a central role in cognition and is the target of most 
      pharmaceuticals for psychiatric disorders. Existing drugs have limited efficacy; 
      creation of improved versions will require better understanding of serotonergic 
      circuitry, which has been hampered by our inability to monitor serotonin release and 
      transport with high spatial and temporal resolution. We developed and applied a 
      binding-pocket redesign strategy, guided by machine learning, to create a 
      high-performance, soluble, fluorescent serotonin sensor (iSeroSnFR), enabling 
      optical detection of millisecond-scale serotonin transients. We demonstrate that 
      iSeroSnFR can be used to detect serotonin release in freely behaving mice during 
      fear conditioning, social interaction, and sleep/wake transitions. We also developed 
      a robust assay of serotonin transporter function and modulation by drugs. We expect 
      that both machine-learning-guided binding-pocket redesign and iSeroSnFR will have 
      broad utility for the development of other sensors and in vitro and in vivo 
      serotonin detection, respectively.

AB  - Research on astronaut health and model organisms have revealed six features of 
      spaceflight biology that guide our current understanding of fundamental molecular 
      changes that occur during space travel. The features include oxidative stress, DNA 
      damage, mitochondrial dysregulation, epigenetic changes (including gene regulation), 
      telomere length alterations, and microbiome shifts. Here we review the known hazards 
      of human spaceflight, how spaceflight affects living systems through these six 
      fundamental features, and the associated health risks of space exploration. We also

AB  - Craniosynostosis results from premature fusion of the cranial suture(s), which 
      contain mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that are crucial for calvarial expansion in 
      coordination with brain growth. Infants with craniosynostosis have skull 
      dysmorphology, increased intracranial pressure, and complications such as 
      neurocognitive impairment that compromise quality of life. Animal models 
      recapitulating these phenotypes are lacking, hampering development of urgently 
      needed innovative therapies. Here, we show that Twist1(+/-) mice with 
      craniosynostosis have increased intracranial pressure and neurocognitive behavioral 
      abnormalities, recapitulating features of human Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. Using a 
      biodegradable material combined with MSCs, we successfully regenerated a functional 
      cranial suture that corrects skull deformity, normalizes intracranial pressure, and 
      rescues neurocognitive behavior deficits. The regenerated suture creates a niche 
      into which endogenous MSCs migrated, sustaining calvarial bone homeostasis and 
      repair. MSC-based cranial suture regeneration offers a paradigm shift in treatment 
      to reverse skull and neurocognitive abnormalities in this devastating disease.

AB  - Strategies for installing authentic ADP-ribosylation (ADPr) at desired positions are 
      fundamental for creating the tools needed to explore this elusive post-translational 
      modification (PTM) in essential cellular processes. Here, we describe a 
      phospho-guided chemoenzymatic approach based on the Ser-ADPr writer complex for 
      rapid, scalable preparation of a panel of pure, precisely modified peptides. 
      Integrating this methodology with phage display technology, we have developed 
      site-specific as well as broad-specificity antibodies to mono-ADPr. These 
      recombinant antibodies have been selected and characterized using multiple 
      ADP-ribosylated peptides and tested by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence for 
      their ability to detect physiological ADPr events. Mono-ADPr proteomics and 
      poly-to-mono comparisons at the modification site level have revealed the prevalence 
      of mono-ADPr upon DNA damage and illustrated its dependence on PARG and ARH3. These 
      and future tools created on our versatile chemical biology-recombinant antibody 
      platform have broad potential to elucidate ADPr signaling pathways in health and 
      disease.

AB  - Proton-coupled monocarboxylate transporters MCT1-4 catalyze the transmembrane 
      movement of metabolically essential monocarboxylates and have been targeted for 
      cancer treatment because of their enhanced expression in various tumors. Here, we 
      report five cryo-EM structures, at resolutions of 3.0-3.3 Å, of human MCT1 bound to 
      lactate or inhibitors in the presence of Basigin-2, a single transmembrane segment 
      (TM)-containing chaperon. MCT1 exhibits similar outward-open conformations when 
      complexed with lactate or the inhibitors BAY-8002 and AZD3965. In the presence of 
      the inhibitor 7ACC2 or with the neutralization of the proton-coupling residue Asp309 
      by Asn, similar inward-open structures were captured. Complemented by 
      structural-guided biochemical analyses, our studies reveal the substrate binding and 
      transport mechanism of MCTs, elucidate the mode of action of three anti-cancer drug 
      candidates, and identify the determinants for subtype-specific sensitivities to 
      AZD3965 by MCT1 and MCT4. These findings lay out an important framework for 
      structure-guided drug discovery targeting MCTs.

AB  - Rapid phasic activity of midbrain dopamine neurons is thought to signal reward 
      prediction errors (RPEs), resembling temporal difference errors used in machine 
      learning. However, recent studies describing slowly increasing dopamine signals have 
      instead proposed that they represent state values and arise independent from somatic 
      spiking activity. Here we developed experimental paradigms using virtual reality 
      that disambiguate RPEs from values. We examined dopamine circuit activity at various 
      stages, including somatic spiking, calcium signals at somata and axons, and striatal 
      dopamine concentrations. Our results demonstrate that ramping dopamine signals are 
      consistent with RPEs rather than value, and this ramping is observed at all stages 
      examined. Ramping dopamine signals can be driven by a dynamic stimulus that 
      indicates a gradual approach to a reward. We provide a unified computational 
      understanding of rapid phasic and slowly ramping dopamine signals: dopamine neurons 
      perform a derivative-like computation over values on a moment-by-moment basis.

AB  - Spaceflight is known to impose changes on human physiology with unknown molecular 
      etiologies. To reveal these causes, we used a multi-omics, systems biology 
      analytical approach using biomedical profiles from fifty-nine astronauts and data 
      from NASA's GeneLab derived from hundreds of samples flown in space to determine 
      transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and epigenetic responses to spaceflight. 
      Overall pathway analyses on the multi-omics datasets showed significant enrichment 
      for mitochondrial processes, as well as innate immunity, chronic inflammation, cell 
      cycle, circadian rhythm, and olfactory functions. Importantly, NASA's Twin Study 
      provided a platform to confirm several of our principal findings. Evidence of 
      altered mitochondrial function and DNA damage was also found in the urine and blood 
      metabolic data compiled from the astronaut cohort and NASA Twin Study data, 
      indicating mitochondrial stress as a consistent phenotype of spaceflight.

AB  - The striosome compartment within the dorsal striatum has been implicated in 
      reinforcement learning and regulation of motivation, but how striosomal neurons 
      contribute to these functions remains elusive. Here, we show that a genetically 
      identified striosomal population, which expresses the Teashirt family zinc finger 1 
      (Tshz1) and belongs to the direct pathway, drives negative reinforcement and is 
      essential for aversive learning in mice. Contrasting a "conventional" striosomal 
      direct pathway, the Tshz1 neurons cause aversion, movement suppression, and negative 
      reinforcement once activated, and they receive a distinct set of synaptic inputs. 
      These neurons are predominantly excited by punishment rather than reward and 
      represent the anticipation of punishment or the motivation for avoidance. 
      Furthermore, inhibiting these neurons impairs punishment-based learning without 
      affecting reward learning or movement. These results establish a major role of 
      striosomal neurons in behaviors reinforced by punishment and moreover uncover 
      functions of the direct pathway unaccounted for in classic models.

AB  - Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) tumors are characterized by high tumor 
      mutation burden and responsiveness to checkpoint blockade. We identified 
      tumor-specific frameshifts encoding multiple epitopes that originated from indel 
      mutations shared among patients with MSI-H endometrial, colorectal, and stomach 
      cancers. Epitopes derived from these shared frameshifts have high population 
      occurrence rates, wide presence in many tumor subclones, and are predicted to bind 
      to the most frequent MHC alleles in MSI-H patient cohorts. Neoantigens arising from 
      these mutations are distinctly unlike self and viral antigens, signifying novel 
      groups of potentially highly immunogenic tumor antigens. We further confirmed the 
      immunogenicity of frameshift peptides in T cell stimulation experiments using blood 
      mononuclear cells isolated from both healthy donors and MSI-H cancer patients. Our 
      study uncovers the widespread occurrence and strong immunogenicity of tumor-specific 
      antigens derived from shared frameshift mutations in MSI-H cancer and Lynch syndrome 
      patients, suitable for the design of common "off-the-shelf" cancer vaccines.

AB  - Single-cell transcriptomics has been widely applied to classify neurons in the 
      mammalian brain, while systems neuroscience has historically analyzed the encoding 
      properties of cortical neurons without considering cell types. Here we examine how 
      specific transcriptomic types of mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC) projection neurons 
      relate to axonal projections and encoding properties across multiple cognitive 
      tasks. We found that most types projected to multiple targets, and most targets 
      received projections from multiple types, except PFC→PAG (periaqueductal gray). By 
      comparing Ca(2+) activity of the molecularly homogeneous PFC→PAG type against two 
      heterogeneous classes in several two-alternative choice tasks in freely moving mice, 
      we found that all task-related signals assayed were qualitatively present in all 
      examined classes. However, PAG-projecting neurons most potently encoded choice in 
      cued tasks, whereas contralateral PFC-projecting neurons most potently encoded 
      reward context in an uncued task. Thus, task signals are organized redundantly, but 
      with clear quantitative biases across cells of specific molecular-anatomical 
      characteristics.

AB  - Working memory is a form of short-term memory that involves maintaining and updating 
      task-relevant information toward goal-directed pursuits. Classical models posit 
      persistent activity in prefrontal cortex (PFC) as a primary neural correlate, but 
      emerging views suggest additional mechanisms may exist. We screened ∼200 genetically 
      diverse mice on a working memory task and identified a genetic locus on chromosome 5 
      that contributes to a substantial proportion (17%) of the phenotypic variance. 
      Within the locus, we identified a gene encoding an orphan G-protein-coupled 
      receptor, Gpr12, which is sufficient to drive substantial and bidirectional changes 
      in working memory. Molecular, cellular, and imaging studies revealed that Gpr12 
      enables high thalamus-PFC synchrony to support memory maintenance and choice 
      accuracy. These findings identify an orphan receptor as a potent modifier of 
      short-term memory and supplement classical PFC-based models with an emerging 
      thalamus-centric framework for the mechanistic understanding of working memory.

AB  - The respiratory and intestinal tracts are exposed to physical and biological hazards 
      accompanying the intake of air and food. Likewise, the vasculature is threatened by 
      inflammation and trauma. Mucin glycoproteins and the related von Willebrand factor 
      guard the vulnerable cell layers in these diverse systems. Colon mucins additionally 
      house and feed the gut microbiome. Here, we present an integrated structural 
      analysis of the intestinal mucin MUC2. Our findings reveal the shared mechanism by 
      which complex macromolecules responsible for blood clotting, mucociliary clearance, 
      and the intestinal mucosal barrier form protective polymers and hydrogels. 
      Specifically, cryo-electron microscopy and crystal structures show how 
      disulfide-rich bridges and pH-tunable interfaces control successive assembly steps 
      in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. Remarkably, a densely 
      O-glycosylated mucin domain performs an organizational role in MUC2. The mucin 
      assembly mechanism and its adaptation for hemostasis provide the foundation for 
      rational manipulation of barrier function and coagulation.

AB  - Exploration of novel environments ensures survival and evolutionary fitness. It is 
      expressed through exploratory bouts and arrests that change dynamically based on 
      experience. Neural circuits mediating exploratory behavior should therefore 
      integrate experience and use it to select the proper behavioral output. Using a 
      spatial exploration assay, we uncovered an experience-dependent increase in 
      momentary arrests in locations where animals arrested previously. Calcium imaging in 
      freely exploring mice revealed a genetically and projection-defined neuronal 
      ensemble in the basolateral amygdala that is active during self-paced behavioral 
      arrests. This ensemble was recruited in an experience-dependent manner, and 
      closed-loop optogenetic manipulation of these neurons revealed that they are 
      sufficient and necessary to drive experience-dependent arrests during exploration. 
      Projection-specific imaging and optogenetic experiments revealed that these arrests 
      are effected by basolateral amygdala neurons projecting to the central amygdala, 
      uncovering an amygdala circuit that mediates momentary arrests in familiar places 
      but not avoidance or anxiety/fear-like behaviors.

AB  - Cells relay a plethora of extracellular signals to specific cellular responses by 
      using only a few second messengers, such as cAMP. To explain signaling specificity, 
      cAMP-degrading phosphodiesterases (PDEs) have been suggested to confine cAMP to 
      distinct cellular compartments. However, measured rates of fast cAMP diffusion and 
      slow PDE activity render cAMP compartmentalization essentially impossible. Using 
      fluorescence spectroscopy, we show that, contrary to earlier data, cAMP at 
      physiological concentrations is predominantly bound to cAMP binding sites and, thus, 
      immobile. Binding and unbinding results in largely reduced cAMP dynamics, which we 
      term "buffered diffusion." With a large fraction of cAMP being buffered, PDEs can 
      create nanometer-size domains of low cAMP concentrations. Using FRET-cAMP 
      nanorulers, we directly map cAMP gradients at the nanoscale around PDE molecules and 
      the areas of resulting downstream activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). 
      Our study reveals that spatiotemporal cAMP signaling is under precise control of 
      nanometer-size domains shaped by PDEs that gate activation of downstream effectors.

AB  - Neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult brain transit from the quiescent state to 
      proliferation to produce new neurons. The mechanisms regulating this transition in 
      freely behaving animals are, however, poorly understood. We customized in vivo 
      imaging protocols to follow NSCs for several days up to months, observing their 
      activation kinetics in freely behaving mice. Strikingly, NSC division is more 
      frequent during daylight and is inhibited by darkness-induced melatonin signaling. 
      The inhibition of melatonin receptors affected intracellular Ca(2+) dynamics and 
      promoted NSC activation. We further discovered a Ca(2+) signature of quiescent 
      versus activated NSCs and showed that several microenvironmental signals converge on 
      intracellular Ca(2+) pathways to regulate NSC quiescence and activation. In vivo 
      NSC-specific optogenetic modulation of Ca(2+) fluxes to mimic quiescent-state-like 
      Ca(2+) dynamics in freely behaving mice blocked NSC activation and maintained their 
      quiescence, pointing to the regulatory mechanisms mediating NSC activation in freely 
      behaving animals.

AB  - Hantaviruses are rodent-borne viruses causing serious zoonotic outbreaks worldwide 
      for which no treatment is available. Hantavirus particles are pleomorphic and 
      display a characteristic square surface lattice. The envelope glycoproteins Gn and 
      Gc form heterodimers that further assemble into tetrameric spikes, the lattice 
      building blocks. The glycoproteins, which are the sole targets of neutralizing 
      antibodies, drive virus entry via receptor-mediated endocytosis and endosomal 
      membrane fusion. Here we describe the high-resolution X-ray structures of the 
      heterodimer of Gc and the Gn head and of the homotetrameric Gn base. Docking them 
      into an 11.4-Å-resolution cryoelectron tomography map of the hantavirus surface 
      accounted for the complete extramembrane portion of the viral glycoprotein shell and 
      allowed a detailed description of the surface organization of these pleomorphic 
      virions. Our results, which further revealed a built-in mechanism controlling 
      Gc membrane insertion for fusion, pave the way for immunogen design to protect 
      against pathogenic hantaviruses.

AB  - CRISPR-Cas defense systems have been coopted multiple times in nature for guide 
      RNA-directed transposition by Tn7-like elements. Prototypic Tn7 uses dedicated 
      proteins for two targeting pathways: one targeting a neutral and conserved 
      attachment site in the chromosome and a second directing transposition into mobile 
      plasmids facilitating cell-to-cell transfer. We show that Tn7-CRISPR-Cas elements 
      evolved a system of guide RNA categorization to accomplish the same two-pathway 
      lifestyle. Multiple mechanisms allow functionally distinct guide RNAs for 
      transposition: a conventional system capable of acquiring guide RNAs to new plasmid 
      and phage targets and a second providing long-term memory for access to chromosomal 
      sites upon entry into a new host. Guide RNAs are privatized to be recognized only by 
      the transposon-adapted system via sequence specialization, mismatch tolerance, and 
      selective regulation to avoid toxic self-targeting by endogenous CRISPR-Cas defense 
      systems. This information reveals promising avenues to engineer guide RNAs for 
      enhanced CRISPR-Cas functionality for genome modification.

AB  - Transcription of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA requires sequential reactions facilitated by the 
      replication and transcription complex (RTC). Here, we present a structural snapshot 
      of SARS-CoV-2 RTC as it transitions toward cap structure synthesis. We determine the 
      atomic cryo-EM structure of an extended RTC assembled by 
      nsp7-nsp8(2)-nsp12-nsp13(2)-RNA and a single RNA-binding protein, nsp9. Nsp9 binds 
      tightly to nsp12 (RdRp) NiRAN, allowing nsp9 N terminus inserting into the catalytic 
      center of nsp12 NiRAN, which then inhibits activity. We also show that nsp12 NiRAN 
      possesses guanylyltransferase activity, catalyzing the formation of cap core 
      structure (GpppA). The orientation of nsp13 that anchors the 5' extension of 
      template RNA shows a remarkable conformational shift, resulting in zinc finger 3 of 
      its ZBD inserting into a minor groove of paired template-primer RNA. These results 
      reason an intermediate state of RTC toward mRNA synthesis, pave a way to understand 
      the RTC architecture, and provide a target for antiviral development.

AB  - Many bacteria use the flagellum for locomotion and chemotaxis. Its bidirectional 
      rotation is driven by a membrane-embedded motor, which uses energy from the 
      transmembrane ion gradient to generate torque at the interface between stator units 
      and rotor. The structural organization of the stator unit (MotAB), its 
      conformational changes upon ion transport, and how these changes power rotation of 
      the flagellum remain unknown. Here, we present ~3 Å-resolution cryoelectron 
      microscopy reconstructions of the stator unit in different functional states. We 
      show that the stator unit consists of a dimer of MotB surrounded by a pentamer of 
      MotA. Combining structural data with mutagenesis and functional studies, we identify 
      key residues involved in torque generation and present a detailed mechanistic model 
      for motor function and switching of rotational direction.

AB  - Animals display wide-ranging evolutionary adaptations based on their ecological 
      niche. Octopuses explore the seafloor with their flexible arms using a specialized 
      "taste by touch" system to locally sense and respond to prey-derived chemicals and 
      movement. How the peripherally distributed octopus nervous system mediates 
      relatively autonomous arm behavior is unknown. Here, we report that octopus arms use 
      a family of cephalopod-specific chemotactile receptors (CRs) to detect poorly 
      soluble natural products, thereby defining a form of contact-dependent, aquatic 
      chemosensation. CRs form discrete ion channel complexes that mediate the detection 
      of diverse stimuli and transduction of specific ionic signals. Furthermore, distinct 
      chemo- and mechanosensory cells exhibit specific receptor expression and electrical 
      activities to support peripheral information coding and complex chemotactile 
      behaviors. These findings demonstrate that the peripherally distributed octopus 
      nervous system is a key site for signal processing and highlight how molecular and 
      anatomical features synergistically evolve to suit an animal's environmental 
      context.

AB  - Ticks transmit a diverse array of microbes to vertebrate hosts, including human 
      pathogens, which has led to a human-centric focus in this vector system. Far less is 
      known about pathogens of ticks themselves. Here, we discover that a toxin in 
      blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) horizontally acquired from bacteria-called 
      domesticated amidase effector 2 (dae2)-has evolved to kill mammalian skin microbes 
      with remarkable efficiency. Secreted into the saliva and gut of ticks, Dae2 limits 
      skin-associated staphylococci in ticks while feeding. In contrast, Dae2 has no 
      intrinsic ability to kill Borrelia burgdorferi, the tick-borne Lyme disease 
      bacterial pathogen. These findings suggest ticks resist their own pathogens while 
      tolerating symbionts. Thus, just as tick symbionts can be pathogenic to humans, 
      mammalian commensals can be harmful to ticks. Our study underscores how virulence is 
      context-dependent and bolsters the idea that "pathogen" is a status and not an 
      identity.

AB  - The hippocampal-entorhinal system is important for spatial and relational memory 
      tasks. We formally link these domains, provide a mechanistic understanding of the 
      hippocampal role in generalization, and offer unifying principles underlying many 
      entorhinal and hippocampal cell types. We propose medial entorhinal cells form a 
      basis describing structural knowledge, and hippocampal cells link this basis with 
      sensory representations. Adopting these principles, we introduce the 
      Tolman-Eichenbaum machine (TEM). After learning, TEM entorhinal cells display 
      diverse properties resembling apparently bespoke spatial responses, such as grid, 
      band, border, and object-vector cells. TEM hippocampal cells include place and 
      landmark cells that remap between environments. Crucially, TEM also aligns with 
      empirically recorded representations in complex non-spatial tasks. TEM also 
      generates predictions that hippocampal remapping is not random as previously 
      believed; rather, structural knowledge is preserved across environments. We confirm 
      this structural transfer over remapping in simultaneously recorded place and grid 
      cells.

AB  - Novel COVID-19 therapeutics are urgently needed. We generated a phage-displayed 
      human antibody V(H) domain library from which we identified a high-affinity V(H) 
      binder ab8. Bivalent V(H), V(H)-Fc ab8, bound with high avidity to 
      membrane-associated S glycoprotein and to mutants found in patients. It potently 
      neutralized mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 in wild-type mice at a dose as low as 2 mg/kg 
      and exhibited high prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in a hamster model of 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection, possibly enhanced by its relatively small size. Electron 
      microscopy combined with scanning mutagenesis identified ab8 interactions with all 
      three S protomers and showed how ab8 neutralized the virus by directly interfering 
      with ACE2 binding. V(H)-Fc ab8 did not aggregate and did not bind to 5,300 human 
      membrane-associated proteins. The potent neutralization activity of V(H)-Fc ab8 
      combined with good developability properties and cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 
      mutants provide a strong rationale for its evaluation as a COVID-19 therapeutic.

AB  - CRISPR-Cas systems provide prokaryotes with acquired immunity against viruses and 
      plasmids, but how these systems are regulated to prevent autoimmunity is poorly 
      understood. Here, we show that in the S. pyogenes CRISPR-Cas system, a long-form 
      transactivating CRISPR RNA (tracr-L) folds into a natural single guide that directs 
      Cas9 to transcriptionally repress its own promoter (P(cas)). Further, we demonstrate 
      that P(cas) serves as a critical regulatory node. De-repression causes a dramatic 
      3,000-fold increase in immunization rates against viruses; however, heightened 
      immunity comes at the cost of increased autoimmune toxicity. Using bioinformatic 
      analyses, we provide evidence that tracrRNA-mediated autoregulation is widespread in 
      type II-A CRISPR-Cas systems. Collectively, we unveil a new paradigm for the 
      intrinsic regulation of CRISPR-Cas systems by natural single guides, which may 
      facilitate the frequent horizontal transfer of these systems into new hosts that 
      have not yet evolved their own regulatory strategies.

AB  - In many eukaryotes, Argonaute proteins, guided by short RNA sequences, defend cells 
      against transposons and viruses. In the eubacterium Thermus thermophilus, the 
      DNA-guided Argonaute TtAgo defends against transformation by DNA plasmids. Here, we 
      report that TtAgo also participates in DNA replication. In vivo, TtAgo binds 15- to 
      18-nt DNA guides derived from the chromosomal region where replication terminates 
      and associates with proteins known to act in DNA replication. When gyrase, the sole 
      T. thermophilus type II topoisomerase, is inhibited, TtAgo allows the bacterium to 
      finish replicating its circular genome. In contrast, loss of gyrase and TtAgo 
      activity slows growth and produces long sausage-like filaments in which the 
      individual bacteria are linked by DNA. Finally, wild-type T. thermophilus 
      outcompetes an otherwise isogenic strain lacking TtAgo. We propose that the primary 
      role of TtAgo is to help T. thermophilus disentangle the catenated circular 
      chromosomes generated by DNA replication.

AB  - Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have emerged as key regulators of a wide variety of 
      biological processes, but the roles of mitochondrial circRNAs are largely unknown. 
      In this issue of Cell, Zhao et al. (2020) reveal that mitochondrial DNA-encoded 
      circRNAs interact with ATP synthase subunit β (ATP5B) to inhibit the output of 
      mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and the activation of liver fibroblasts, which 
      regulate the pathogenesis of liver disease.

AB  - Wnts are evolutionarily conserved ligands that signal at short range to regulate 
      morphogenesis, cell fate, and stem cell renewal. The first and essential steps in 
      Wnt secretion are their O-palmitoleation and subsequent loading onto the dedicated 
      transporter Wntless/evenness interrupted (WLS/Evi). We report the 3.2 Å resolution 
      cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of palmitoleated human WNT8A in 
      complex with WLS. This is accompanied by biochemical experiments to probe the 
      physiological implications of the observed association. The WLS membrane domain has 
      close structural homology to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). A Wnt hairpin 
      inserts into a conserved hydrophobic cavity in the GPCR-like domain, and the 
      palmitoleate protrudes between two helices into the bilayer. A conformational switch 
      of highly conserved residues on a separate Wnt hairpin might contribute to its 
      transfer to receiving cells. This work provides molecular-level insights into a 
      central mechanism in animal body plan development and stem cell biology.

AB  - Cellular functioning requires the orchestration of thousands of molecular 
      interactions in time and space. Yet most molecules in a cell move by diffusion, 
      which is sensitive to external factors like temperature. How cells sustain complex, 
      diffusion-based systems across wide temperature ranges is unknown. Here, we uncover 
      a mechanism by which budding yeast modulate viscosity in response to temperature and 
      energy availability. This "viscoadaptation" uses regulated synthesis of glycogen and 
      trehalose to vary the viscosity of the cytosol. Viscoadaptation functions as a 
      stress response and a homeostatic mechanism, allowing cells to maintain invariant 
      diffusion across a 20°C temperature range. Perturbations to viscoadaptation affect 
      solubility and phase separation, suggesting that viscoadaptation may have 
      implications for multiple biophysical processes in the cell. Conditions that lower 
      ATP trigger viscoadaptation, linking energy availability to rate regulation of 
      diffusion-controlled processes. Viscoadaptation reveals viscosity to be a tunable 
      property for regulating diffusion-controlled processes in a changing environment.

AB  - All proteins interact with other cellular components to fulfill their function. 
      While tremendous progress has been made in the identification of protein complexes, 
      their assembly and dynamics remain difficult to characterize. Here, we present a 
      high-throughput strategy to analyze the native assembly kinetics of protein 
      complexes. We apply our approach to characterize the co-assembly for 320 pairs of 
      nucleoporins (NUPs) constituting the ≈50 MDa nuclear pore complex (NPC) in yeast. 
      Some NUPs co-assemble fast via rapid exchange whereas others require lengthy 
      maturation steps. This reveals a hierarchical principle of NPC biogenesis where 
      individual subcomplexes form on a minute timescale and then co-assemble from center 
      to periphery in a ∼1 h-long maturation process. Intriguingly, the NUP Mlp1 stands 
      out as joining very late and associating preferentially with aged NPCs. Our approach 
      is readily applicable beyond the NPC, making it possible to analyze the 
      intracellular dynamics of a variety of multiprotein assemblies.

AB  - The curse of dimensionality plagues models of reinforcement learning and decision 
      making. The process of abstraction solves this by constructing variables describing 
      features shared by different instances, reducing dimensionality and enabling 
      generalization in novel situations. Here, we characterized neural representations in 
      monkeys performing a task described by different hidden and explicit variables. 
      Abstraction was defined operationally using the generalization performance of neural 
      decoders across task conditions not used for training, which requires a particular 
      geometry of neural representations. Neural ensembles in prefrontal cortex, 
      hippocampus, and simulated neural networks simultaneously represented multiple 
      variables in a geometry reflecting abstraction but that still allowed a linear 
      classifier to decode a large number of other variables (high shattering 
      dimensionality). Furthermore, this geometry changed in relation to task events and 
      performance. These findings elucidate how the brain and artificial systems represent 
      variables in an abstract format while preserving the advantages conferred by high 
      shattering dimensionality.

AB  - Biological processes are regulated by intermolecular interactions and chemical 
      modifications that do not affect protein levels, thus escaping detection in 
      classical proteomic screens. We demonstrate here that a global protein structural 
      readout based on limited proteolysis-mass spectrometry (LiP-MS) detects many such 
      functional alterations, simultaneously and in situ, in bacteria undergoing nutrient 
      adaptation and in yeast responding to acute stress. The structural readout, 
      visualized as structural barcodes, captured enzyme activity changes, 
      phosphorylation, protein aggregation, and complex formation, with the resolution of 
      individual regulated functional sites such as binding and active sites. Comparison 
      with prior knowledge, including other 'omics data, showed that LiP-MS detects many 
      known functional alterations within well-studied pathways. It suggested distinct 
      metabolite-protein interactions and enabled identification of a 
      fructose-1,6-bisphosphate-based regulatory mechanism of glucose uptake in E. coli. 
      The structural readout dramatically increases classical proteomics coverage, 
      generates mechanistic hypotheses, and paves the way for in situ structural systems 
      biology.

AB  - Hardwired circuits encoding innate responses have emerged as an essential feature of 
      the mammalian brain. Sweet and bitter evoke opposing predetermined behaviors. Sweet 
      drives appetitive responses and consumption of energy-rich food sources, whereas 
      bitter prevents ingestion of toxic chemicals. Here we identified and characterized 
      the neurons in the brainstem that transmit sweet and bitter signals from the tongue 
      to the cortex. Next we examined how the brain modulates this hardwired circuit to 
      control taste behaviors. We dissect the basis for bitter-evoked suppression of sweet 
      taste and show that the taste cortex and amygdala exert strong positive and negative 
      feedback onto incoming bitter and sweet signals in the brainstem. Finally we 
      demonstrate that blocking the feedback markedly alters responses to ethologically 
      relevant taste stimuli. These results illustrate how hardwired circuits can be 
      finely regulated by top-down control and reveal the neural basis of an indispensable 
      behavioral response for all animals.

AB  - Learning valence-based responses to favorable and unfavorable options requires 
      judgments of the relative value of the options, a process necessary for species 
      survival. We found, using engineered mice, that circuit connectivity and function of 
      the striosome compartment of the striatum are critical for this type of learning. 
      Calcium imaging during valence-based learning exhibited a selective correlation 
      between learning and striosomal but not matrix signals. This striosomal activity 
      encoded discrimination learning and was correlated with task engagement, which, in 
      turn, could be regulated by chemogenetic excitation and inhibition. Striosomal 
      function during discrimination learning was disturbed with aging and severely so in 
      a mouse model of Huntington's disease. Anatomical and functional connectivity of 
      parvalbumin-positive, putative fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) to striatal 
      projection neurons was enhanced in striosomes compared with matrix in mice that 
      learned. Computational modeling of these findings suggests that FSIs can modulate 
      the striosomal signal-to-noise ratio, crucial for discrimination and learning.

AB  - Comprehensively resolving neuronal identities in whole-brain images is a major 
      challenge. We achieve this in C. elegans by engineering a multicolor transgene 
      called NeuroPAL (a neuronal polychromatic atlas of landmarks). NeuroPAL worms share 
      a stereotypical multicolor fluorescence map for the entire hermaphrodite nervous 
      system that resolves all neuronal identities. Neurons labeled with NeuroPAL do not 
      exhibit fluorescence in the green, cyan, or yellow emission channels, allowing the 
      transgene to be used with numerous reporters of gene expression or neuronal 
      dynamics. We showcase three applications that leverage NeuroPAL for 
      nervous-system-wide neuronal identification. First, we determine the brainwide 
      expression patterns of all metabotropic receptors for acetylcholine, GABA, and 
      glutamate, completing a map of this communication network. Second, we uncover 
      changes in cell fate caused by transcription factor mutations. Third, we record 
      brainwide activity in response to attractive and repulsive chemosensory cues, 
      characterizing multimodal coding for these stimuli.

AB  - Banyan trees are distinguished by their extraordinary aerial roots. The Ficus genus 
      includes species that have evolved a species-specific mutualism system with wasp 
      pollinators. We sequenced genomes of the Chinese banyan tree, F. microcarpa, and a 
      species lacking aerial roots, F. hispida, and one wasp genome coevolving with 
      F. microcarpa, Eupristina verticillata. Comparative analysis of the two Ficus 
      genomes revealed dynamic karyotype variation associated with adaptive evolution. 
      Copy number expansion of auxin-related genes from duplications and elevated auxin 
      production are associated with aerial root development in F. microcarpa. A 
      male-specific AGAMOUS paralog, FhAG2, was identified as a candidate gene for sex 
      determination in F. hispida. Population genomic analyses of Ficus species revealed 
      genomic signatures of morphological and physiological coadaptation with their 
      pollinators involving terpenoid- and benzenoid-derived compounds. These three 
      genomes offer insights into and genomic resources for investigating the geneses of 
      aerial roots, monoecy and dioecy, and codiversification in a symbiotic system.

AB  - Muscle spasticity after nervous system injuries and painful low back spasm affect 
      more than 10% of global population. Current medications are of limited efficacy and 
      cause neurological and cardiovascular side effects because they target upstream 
      regulators of muscle contraction. Direct myosin inhibition could provide optimal 
      muscle relaxation; however, targeting skeletal myosin is particularly challenging 
      because of its similarity to the cardiac isoform. We identified a key residue 
      difference between these myosin isoforms, located in the communication center of the 
      functional regions, which allowed us to design a selective inhibitor, MPH-220. 
      Mutagenic analysis and the atomic structure of MPH-220-bound skeletal muscle myosin 
      confirmed the mechanism of specificity. Targeting skeletal muscle myosin by MPH-220 
      enabled muscle relaxation, in human and model systems, without cardiovascular side 
      effects and improved spastic gait disorders after brain injury in a disease model. 
      MPH-220 provides a potential nervous-system-independent option to treat spasticity 
      and muscle stiffness.

AB  - The human immunodeficiency virus, the lentivirus that causes AIDS, is responsible 
      for the most prevalent epidemic in the history of mankind. Here in this Timeline, we 
      have attempted to illustrate a short history of HIV-1, from its identification in 
      landmark papers published by Robert Gallo, Myron Essex, and Luc Montagnier, to the 
      numerous drug and vaccine trials as well as the stride toward a possible cure. Even 
      today, a vaccine and cure against HIV-1 remains elusive. In spite of this, in the 
      space of 30 years, from the time when being HIV positive meant an instant death 
      sentence, to today where millions of HIV positive people are living normal lives, 
      the progress we have made in such a short period of time should be celebrated. To 
      view this Timeline, open or download the PDF.

AB  - Infectious diseases killed hundreds of million people, made empires and 
      civilizations vulnerable, and recently took away our freedom to go out, walk, work, 
      travel, meet friends, and visit relatives during the Covid-19 lockdown. Vaccination 
      freed humans from most of infectious diseases of the past. By starting with a virus 
      grown in a cow, vaccination has been propelled by new technologies such as viral 
      growth in eggs and cell culture, chemical conjugation, recombinant DNA, genomics, 
      and synthetic biology. The revolutionary progress in science and technologies 
      increases the confidence that vaccines will continue to provide solutions for the 
      wellbeing of modern society.

AB  - Both transcription and three-dimensional (3D) architecture of the mammalian genome 
      play critical roles in neurodevelopment and its disorders. However, 3D genome 
      structures of single brain cells have not been solved; little is known about the 
      dynamics of single-cell transcriptome and 3D genome after birth. Here, we generated 
      a transcriptome (3,517 cells) and 3D genome (3,646 cells) atlas of the developing 
      mouse cortex and hippocampus by using our high-resolution multiple annealing and 
      looping-based amplification cycles for digital transcriptomics (MALBAC-DT) and 
      diploid chromatin conformation capture (Dip-C) methods and developing multi-omic 
      analysis pipelines. In adults, 3D genome "structure types" delineate all major cell 
      types, with high correlation between chromatin A/B compartments and gene expression. 
      During development, both transcriptome and 3D genome are extensively transformed in 
      the first post-natal month. In neurons, 3D genome is rewired across scales, 
      correlated with gene expression modules, and independent of sensory experience. 
      Finally, we examine allele-specific structure of imprinted genes, revealing local 
      and chromosome (chr)-wide differences. These findings uncover an unknown dimension 
      of neurodevelopment.

AB  - Determination of what is the specificity of subunits composing a protein complex is 
      essential when studying gene variants on human pathophysiology. The pore-forming 
      α-subunit KCNQ1, which belongs to the voltage-gated ion channel superfamily, 
      associates to its β-auxiliary subunit KCNE1 to generate the slow cardiac potassium 
      I(Ks) current, whose dysfunction leads to cardiac arrhythmia. Using pharmacology, 
      gene invalidation, and single-molecule fluorescence assays, we found that KCNE1 
      fulfils all criteria of a bona fide auxiliary subunit of the TMEM16A chloride 
      channel, which belongs to the anoctamin superfamily. Strikingly, assembly with KCNE1 
      switches TMEM16A from a calcium-dependent to a voltage-dependent ion channel. 
      Importantly, clinically relevant inherited mutations within the TMEM16A-regulating 
      domain of KCNE1 abolish the TMEM16A modulation, suggesting that the TMEM16A-KCNE1 
      current may contribute to inherited pathologies. Altogether, these findings 
      challenge the dogma of the specificity of auxiliary subunits regarding protein 
      complexes and questions ion channel classification.

AB  - Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an oncogenic human herpesvirus that persists as a 
      multicopy episome in proliferating host cells. Episome maintenance is strictly 
      dependent on EBNA1, a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein with no known enzymatic 
      activities. Here, we show that EBNA1 forms a cell cycle-dependent DNA crosslink with 
      the EBV origin of plasmid replication oriP. EBNA1 tyrosine 518 (Y518) is essential 
      for crosslinking to oriP and functionally required for episome maintenance and 
      generation of EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). Mechanistically, 
      Y518 is required for replication fork termination at oriP in vivo and for formation 
      of SDS-resistant complexes in vitro. EBNA1-DNA crosslinking corresponds to 
      single-strand endonuclease activity specific to DNA structures enriched at 
      replication-termination sites, such as 4-way junctions. These findings reveal that 
      EBNA1 forms tyrosine-dependent DNA-protein crosslinks and single-strand cleavage at 
      oriP required for replication termination and viral episome maintenance.

      Drosophila.

AB  - Aggression involves both sexually monomorphic and dimorphic actions. How the brain 
      implements these two types of actions is poorly understood. We have identified three 
      cell types that regulate aggression in Drosophila: one type is sexually shared, and 
      the other two are sex specific. Shared common aggression-promoting (CAP) neurons 
      mediate aggressive approach in both sexes, whereas functionally downstream dimorphic 
      but homologous cell types, called male-specific aggression-promoting (MAP) neurons 
      in males and fpC1 in females, control dimorphic attack. These symmetric circuits 
      underlie the divergence of male and female aggressive behaviors, from their 
      monomorphic appetitive/motivational to their dimorphic consummatory phases. The 
      strength of the monomorphic → dimorphic functional connection is increased by social 
      isolation in both sexes, suggesting that it may be a locus for isolation-dependent 
      enhancement of aggression. Together, these findings reveal a circuit logic for the 
      neural control of behaviors that include both sexually monomorphic and dimorphic 
      actions, which may generalize to other organisms.

AB  - Malaria is a prominent vector-borne illness caused by Plasmodium parasites. 
      Therapeutic intervention remains a critical component for disease eradication 
      efforts but is complicated by the emergence of drug resistance. This SnapShot 
      summarizes the human-relevant stages of the P. falciparum life cycle and describes 
      how licensed antimalarials, clinical candidates, and newly emerging compounds target 
      each stage to prevent, treat, or block transmission of malaria. To view this

AB  - As of 2020, fewer than 600 individuals have left Earth to experience work and life 
      in space. That number will grow as government-funded and commercial space programs 
      move forward in countries around the globe. There are however major questions about 
      how humans respond to spaceflight at every level, from the whole body to individual 
      organs to specific cells to molecular pathways. Preparing for a future where 
      longer-duration spaceflights are anticipated and people can begin to contemplate 
      space tourism, researchers are studying astronauts to understand how the human 
      system is affected by and adapts to space. Lara Szewczak got a window on this world, 
      speaking with retired astronaut Scott Kelly about his late-blooming interest in 
      science, what he's learned through the NASA Twins Study, and why space vacations 
      might not be for everyone. They were joined by Chris Mason, a lead investigator 
      looking at the 'omics of spaceflight. Excerpts from this conversation are presented 
      below, and the full conversation is available with the article online.

AB  - Ophthalmic, maxillary, and mandibular branches of the trigeminal nerve provide 
      sensory innervation to orofacial tissues. Trigeminal sensory neurons respond to a 
      diverse array of sensory stimuli to generate distinct sensations, including 
      thermosensation, mechanosensation, itching, and pain. These sensory neurons also 
      detect the distinct sharpness or pungency of many foods and beverages. This SnapShot 
      highlights the transduction ion channels critical to orofacial sensation.

AB  - Communal discussions on anti-racism and inclusion are crucial to addressing the 
      history of racism in scientific communities. Unfortunately, universities are not 
      universally implementing these conversations. We provide a blueprint for initiating 
      and executing student-led discussions to empower young scientists to take action 
      toward making science more welcoming and inclusive.

AB  - Cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is an ancient second messenger but 
      organizing signaling selectivity on the nanoscale is poorly understood. Examining 
      transport of a new fluorescent cAMP probe, Bock and coworkers observe "buffered 
      diffusion" and establish phosphodiesterase activity can organize cAMP nanodomains, 
      while Zhao and coworkers find that protein kinase A regulatory subunits assemble 
      liquid droplets to further localize cAMP signaling.

AB  - Whittington et al. demonstrate how network architectures defined in a spatial 
      context may be useful for inference on different types of relational knowledge. 
      These architectures allow for learning the structure of the environment and then 
      transferring that knowledge to allow prediction of novel transitions.

AB  - Building tissues from scratch to explore entirely new cell configurations could 
      revolutionize fundamental understanding in biology. Bioprinting is an emerging 
      technology to do this. Although typically applied to engineer tissues for 
      therapeutic tissue repair or drug screening, there are many opportunities for 
      bioprinting within biology, such as for exploring cellular crosstalk or cellular 
      morphogenesis. The overall goals of this Primer are to provide an overview of 
      bioprinting with the biologist in mind, outline the steps in extrusion bioprinting 
      (the most widely used and accessible technology), and discuss alternative 
      bioprinting technologies and future opportunities for bioprinting in biology.

AB  - Immune checkpoints are key regulatory mechanisms integral to the maintenance of 
      self-tolerance and execution of antigen-specific immune responses. In recent years, 
      they have been leveraged to treat both autoimmune disease and various forms of 
      cancer with much success. This SnapShot illustrates known immune checkpoint 
      interactions in APC-mediated T cell modulation. To view this SnapShot, open or

AB  - In this issue of Cell, Zuccaro and colleagues show that on-target Cas9-mediated 
      double-strand breaks cause chromosome loss or mis-repair of the disease allele in > 
      90% of human embryos. End joining repair pathways dominate, causing small insertions 
      or deletions, which raises serious questions about using double-strand breaks for 
      "gene surgery".

AB  - Operation Outbreak (OO) is a Bluetooth-based simulation platform that teaches 
      students how pathogens spread and the impact of interventions, thereby facilitating 
      the safe reopening of schools. OO also generates data to inform epidemiological 
      models and prevent future outbreaks. Before SARS-CoV-2 was reported, we repeatedly 
      simulated a virus with similar features, correctly predicting many human behaviors 
      later observed during the pandemic.

AB  - The ultra-rare, pediatric premature aging disorder Hutchinson-Gilford progeria 
      syndrome (HGPS) is caused by mutation of LMNA, encoding the nuclear architectural 
      protein lamin A. Patients develop atherosclerosis and typically die of heart failure 
      in their teens. FDA-approved Zokinvy prevents farnesylation of lamin A, reduces 
      vascular stiffness, and extends survival in HGPS patients. To view this Bench to

AB  - We identify problematic areas throughout the Science, Technology, Engineering and 
      Mathematics (STEM) pipeline that perpetuate racial disparities in academia. Distinct 
      ways to curtail these disparities include early exposure and access to resources, 
      supportive mentoring networks and comprehensive training programs specifically for 
      racially minoritized students and trainees at each career stage. These actions will 
      revitalize the STEM pipeline.

      participates in DNA replication by unlinking catenated chromosomes.

AB  - PD1/PD-L1-directed immunotherapy, alone or in combination with chemotherapy, 
      dominates the initial treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. However, 
      our ability to predict who will benefit from these approaches is limited. In this

AB  - In this issue of Cell, Ringel et al. reveal a link between lipid utilization in the 
      tumor microenvironment and anti-tumor immunity in obese mice. These findings provide 
      one explanation for how obesity worsens cancer outcomes and may point to a new 
      metabolic approach to treating some cancers.

AB  - The Eastern Eurasian Steppe was home to historic empires of nomadic pastoralists, 
      including the Xiongnu and the Mongols. However, little is known about the region's 
      population history. Here, we reveal its dynamic genetic history by analyzing new 
      genome-wide data for 214 ancient individuals spanning 6,000 years. We identify a 
      pastoralist expansion into Mongolia ca. 3000 BCE, and by the Late Bronze Age, 
      Mongolian populations were biogeographically structured into three distinct groups, 
      all practicing dairy pastoralism regardless of ancestry. The Xiongnu emerged from 
      the mixing of these populations and those from surrounding regions. By comparison, 
      the Mongols exhibit much higher eastern Eurasian ancestry, resembling present-day 
      Mongolic-speaking populations. Our results illuminate the complex interplay between 
      genetic, sociopolitical, and cultural changes on the Eastern Steppe.

AB  - Defining the principles underlying the organization of biomolecules within cells is 
      a key challenge of current cell biology research. Persson et al. now identify a 
      powerful layer of regulation that allows cells to decouple diffusion from 
      temperature by modulating their intracellular viscosity. This so-called 
      viscoadaptation is mediated through trehalose and glycogen activities, which alter 
      diffusion dynamics and self-assembly propensity inside the cell globally.

AB  - Every day we make decisions critical for adaptation and survival. We repeat actions 
      with known consequences. But we also draw on loosely related events to infer and 
      imagine the outcome of entirely novel choices. These inferential decisions are 
      thought to engage a number of brain regions; however, the underlying neuronal 
      computation remains unknown. Here, we use a multi-day cross-species approach in 
      humans and mice to report the functional anatomy and neuronal computation underlying 
      inferential decisions. We show that during successful inference, the mammalian brain 
      uses a hippocampal prospective code to forecast temporally structured learned 
      associations. Moreover, during resting behavior, coactivation of hippocampal cells 
      in sharp-wave/ripples represent inferred relationships that include reward, thereby 
      "joining-the-dots" between events that have not been observed together but lead to 
      profitable outcomes. Computing mnemonic links in this manner may provide an 
      important mechanism to build a cognitive map that stretches beyond direct 
      experience, thus supporting flexible behavior.

AB  - Ha and colleagues describe a previously unappreciated diversity of microbes in the 
      mesenteric adipose tissue (MAT) surrounding the GI tract. Viable bacteria that are 
      mislocalized from the gut microbiota and metabolically adapted to the MAT contribute 
      to the "creeping fat" of Crohn's disease.

AB  - Sequential activation of neurons has been observed during various behavioral and 
      cognitive processes, but the underlying circuit mechanisms remain poorly understood. 
      Here, we investigate premotor sequences in HVC (proper name) of the adult zebra 
      finch forebrain that are central to the performance of the temporally precise 
      courtship song. We use high-density silicon probes to measure song-related 
      population activity, and we compare these observations with predictions from a range 
      of network models. Our results support a circuit architecture in which heterogeneous 
      delays between sequentially active neurons shape the spatiotemporal patterns of HVC 
      premotor neuron activity. We gauge the impact of several delay sources, and we find 
      the primary contributor to be slow conduction through axonal collaterals within HVC, 
      which typically adds between 1 and 7.5 ms for each link within the sequence. Thus, 
      local axonal "delay lines" can play an important role in determining the dynamical 
      repertoire of neural circuits.

AB  - Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is one of the most virulent viruses endemic 
      to North America. No licensed vaccines or antiviral therapeutics are available to 
      combat this infection, which has recently shown an increase in human cases. Here, we 
      characterize human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) isolated from a survivor of natural 
      EEEV infection with potent (<20 pM) inhibitory activity of EEEV. Cryo-electron 
      microscopy reconstructions of two highly neutralizing mAbs, EEEV-33 and EEEV-143, 
      were solved in complex with chimeric Sindbis/EEEV virions to 7.2 Å and 8.3 Å, 
      respectively. The mAbs recognize two distinct antigenic sites that are critical for 
      inhibiting viral entry into cells. EEEV-33 and EEEV-143 protect against disease 
      following stringent lethal aerosol challenge of mice with highly pathogenic EEEV. 
      These studies provide insight into the molecular basis for the neutralizing human 
      antibody response against EEEV and can facilitate development of vaccines and 
      candidate antibody therapeutics.

AB  - Hippocampal activity represents many behaviorally important variables, including 
      context, an animal's location within a given environmental context, time, and 
      reward. Using longitudinal calcium imaging in mice, multiple large virtual 
      environments, and differing reward contingencies, we derived a unified probabilistic 
      model of CA1 representations centered on a single feature-the field propensity. Each 
      cell's propensity governs how many place fields it has per unit space, predicts its 
      reward-related activity, and is preserved across distinct environments and over 
      months. Propensity is broadly distributed-with many low, and some very high, 
      propensity cells-and thus strongly shapes hippocampal representations. This results 
      in a range of spatial codes, from sparse to dense. Propensity varied ∼10-fold 
      between adjacent cells in salt-and-pepper fashion, indicating substantial functional 
      differences within a presumed cell type. Intracellular recordings linked propensity 
      to cell excitability. The stability of each cell's propensity across conditions 
      suggests this fundamental property has anatomical, transcriptional, and/or 
      developmental origins.

AB  - To manifest our sincerest aspirations to "enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce 
      illness and disability," the US biomedical research enterprise must directly 
      confront the reality of structural racism in scientific funding and the widespread 
      denial of its existence. I believe that moment in American history has, at long 
      last, arrived.

AB  - Several HIV-1 and SIV vaccine candidates have shown partial protection against viral 
      challenges in rhesus macaques. However, the protective efficacy of vaccine-elicited 
      polyclonal antibodies has not previously been demonstrated in adoptive transfer 
      studies in nonhuman primates. In this study, we show that passive transfer of 
      purified antibodies from vaccinated macaques can protect naive animals against 
      SIVmac251 challenges. We vaccinated 30 rhesus macaques with Ad26-SIV Env/Gag/Pol and 
      SIV Env gp140 protein vaccines and assessed the induction of antibody responses and 
      a putative protective signature. This signature included multiple antibody functions 
      and correlated with upregulation of interferon pathways in vaccinated animals. 
      Adoptive transfer of purified immunoglobulin G (IgG) from the vaccinated animals 
      with the most robust protective signatures provided partial protection against 
      SIVmac251 challenges in naive recipient rhesus macaques. These data demonstrate the 
      protective efficacy of purified vaccine-elicited antiviral antibodies in this model, 
      even in the absence of virus neutralization.

AB  - The generation of functional genomics datasets is surging, because they provide 
      insight into gene regulation and organismal phenotypes (e.g., genes upregulated in 
      cancer). The intent behind functional genomics experiments is not necessarily to 
      study genetic variants, yet they pose privacy concerns due to their use of 
      next-generation sequencing. Moreover, there is a great incentive to broadly share 
      raw reads for better statistical power and general research reproducibility. Thus, 
      we need new modes of sharing beyond traditional controlled-access models. Here, we 
      develop a data-sanitization procedure allowing raw functional genomics reads to be 
      shared while minimizing privacy leakage, enabling principled privacy-utility 
      trade-offs. Our protocol works with traditional Illumina-based assays and newer 
      technologies such as 10x single-cell RNA sequencing. It involves quantifying the 
      privacy leakage in reads by statistically linking study participants to known 
      individuals. We carried out these linkages using data from highly accurate reference 
      genomes and more realistic environmental samples.

AB  - Many embryonic organs undergo epithelial morphogenesis to form tree-like 
      hierarchical structures. However, it remains unclear what drives the budding and 
      branching of stratified epithelia, such as in the embryonic salivary gland and 
      pancreas. Here, we performed live-organ imaging of mouse embryonic salivary glands 
      at single-cell resolution to reveal that budding morphogenesis is driven by 
      expansion and folding of a distinct epithelial surface cell sheet characterized by 
      strong cell-matrix adhesions and weak cell-cell adhesions. Profiling of single-cell 
      transcriptomes of this epithelium revealed spatial patterns of transcription 
      underlying these cell adhesion differences. We then synthetically reconstituted 
      budding morphogenesis by experimentally suppressing E-cadherin expression and 
      inducing basement membrane formation in 3D spheroid cultures of engineered cells, 
      which required β1-integrin-mediated cell-matrix adhesion for successful budding. 
      Thus, stratified epithelial budding, the key first step of branching morphogenesis, 
      is driven by an overall combination of strong cell-matrix adhesion and weak 
      cell-cell adhesion by peripheral epithelial cells.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has revealed that Africa needs a new public health order to 
      be resilient, to adapt, and to cope with 21st-century disease threats. The new order 
      will need strengthened continental and national public health institutions; local 
      manufacturing of vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics; attraction, training, and 
      retention of a public health workforce; and fostering of respectful local and

AB  - For many species, migrating at just the right time is essential for both survival 
      and reproduction. A new study in salmon localizes a small genomic region associated 
      with migration timing, which in turn affects other physiological traits, suggesting 
      that a seemingly complex suite of migration traits is linked by one "simple" 
      phenotype.

AB  - Children and adults with atopic dermatitis suffer from intractable chronic itch and 
      can also experience acute itch flare ups that significantly increase itch intensity. 
      In this issue of Cell, Wang et al. demonstrate that a subset of basophils activates 
      sensory neurons to drive allergen-evoked itch flare ups in atopic dermatitis.

AB  - In many asthmatics, chronic airway inflammation is driven by IL-4-, IL-5-, and 
      IL-13-producing Th2 cells or ILC2s. Type 2 cytokines promote hallmark features of 
      the disease such as eosinophilia, mucus hypersecretion, bronchial 
      hyperresponsiveness (BHR), IgE production, and susceptibility to exacerbations. 
      However, only half the asthmatics have this "type 2-high" signature, and "type 
      2-low" asthma is more associated with obesity, presence of neutrophils, and 
      unresponsiveness to corticosteroids, the mainstay asthma therapy. Here, we review 
      the underlying immunological basis of various asthma endotypes by discussing results 
      obtained from animal studies as well as results generated in clinical studies 
      targeting specific immune pathways.

AB  - Rapid increases of energy consumption and human dependency on fossil fuels have led 
      to the accumulation of greenhouse gases and consequently, climate change. As such, 
      major efforts have been taken to develop, test, and adopt clean renewable fuel 
      alternatives. Production of bioethanol and biodiesel from crops is well developed, 
      while other feedstock resources and processes have also shown high potential to 
      provide efficient and cost-effective alternatives, such as landfill and plastic 
      waste conversion, algal photosynthesis, as well as electrochemical carbon fixation. 
      In addition, the downstream microbial fermentation can be further engineered to not 
      only increase the product yield but also expand the chemical space of biofuels 
      through the rational design and fine-tuning of biosynthetic pathways toward the 
      realization of "designer fuels" and diverse future applications.

AB  - Rubisco, the key enzyme of CO(2) fixation in photosynthesis, is prone to 
      inactivation by inhibitory sugar phosphates. Inhibited Rubisco undergoes 
      conformational repair by the hexameric AAA+ chaperone Rubisco activase (Rca) in a 
      process that is not well understood. Here, we performed a structural and mechanistic 
      analysis of cyanobacterial Rca, a close homolog of plant Rca. In the Rca:Rubisco 
      complex, Rca is positioned over the Rubisco catalytic site under repair and pulls 
      the N-terminal tail of the large Rubisco subunit (RbcL) into the hexamer pore. 
      Simultaneous displacement of the C terminus of the adjacent RbcL opens the catalytic 
      site for inhibitor release. An alternative interaction of Rca with Rubisco is 
      mediated by C-terminal domains that resemble the small Rubisco subunit. These 
      domains, together with the N-terminal AAA+ hexamer, ensure that Rca is packaged with 
      Rubisco into carboxysomes. The cyanobacterial Rca is a dual-purpose protein with 
      functions in Rubisco repair and carboxysome organization.

AB  - Environmental insults impair human health around the world. Contaminated air, water, 
      soil, food, and occupational and household settings expose humans of all ages to a 
      plethora of chemicals and environmental stressors. We propose eight hallmarks of 
      environmental insults that jointly underpin the damaging impact of environmental 
      exposures during the lifespan. Specifically, they include oxidative stress and 
      inflammation, genomic alterations and mutations, epigenetic alterations, 
      mitochondrial dysfunction, endocrine disruption, altered intercellular 
      communication, altered microbiome communities, and impaired nervous system function. 
      They provide a framework to understand why complex mixtures of environmental 
      exposures induce severe health effects even at relatively modest concentrations.

AB  - Plant intracellular NLR proteins detect pathogen effectors and then form multimeric 
      protein complexes ("resistosomes") that activate immune responses and cell death 
      through unknown mechanisms. In this issue of Cell, Bi et al. show that the ZAR1 
      resistosome exhibits cation channel activity, enabling calcium influx that activates 
      defense mechanisms and culminates in cell death.

AB  - A fundamental challenge in synthetic biology is to create molecular circuits that 
      can program complex cellular functions. Because proteins can bind, cleave, and 
      chemically modify one another and interface directly and rapidly with endogenous 
      pathways, they could extend the capabilities of synthetic circuits beyond what is 
      possible with gene regulation alone. However, the very diversity that makes proteins 
      so powerful also complicates efforts to harness them as well-controlled synthetic 
      circuit components. Recent work has begun to address this challenge, focusing on 
      principles such as orthogonality and composability that permit construction of 
      diverse circuit-level functions from a limited set of engineered protein components. 
      These approaches are now enabling the engineering of circuits that can sense, 
      transmit, and process information; dynamically control cellular behaviors; and 
      enable new therapeutic strategies, establishing a powerful paradigm for programming 
      biology.

AB  - Eukaryotic DNA-binding proteins operate in the context of chromatin, where 
      nucleosomes are the elementary building blocks. Nucleosomal DNA is wrapped around a 
      histone core, thereby rendering a large fraction of the DNA surface inaccessible to 
      DNA-binding proteins. Nevertheless, first responders in DNA repair and 
      sequence-specific transcription factors bind DNA target sites obstructed by 
      chromatin. While early studies examined protein binding to histone-free DNA, it is 
      only now beginning to emerge how DNA sequences are interrogated on nucleosomes. 
      These readout strategies range from the release of nucleosomal DNA from histones, to 
      rotational/translation register shifts of the DNA motif, and nucleosome-specific DNA 
      binding modes that differ from those observed on naked DNA. Since DNA motif 
      engagement on nucleosomes strongly depends on position and orientation, we argue 
      that motif location and nucleosome positioning co-determine protein access to DNA in 
      transcription and DNA repair.

AB  - cis-regulatory elements (CREs) encode the genomic blueprints of spatiotemporal gene 
      expression programs enabling highly specialized cell functions. Using single-cell 
      genomics in six maize organs, we determined the cis- and trans-regulatory factors 
      defining diverse cell identities and coordinating chromatin organization by 
      profiling transcription factor (TF) combinatorics, identifying TFs with 
      non-cell-autonomous activity, and uncovering TFs underlying higher-order chromatin 
      interactions. Cell-type-specific CREs were enriched for enhancer activity and within 
      unmethylated long terminal repeat retrotransposons. Moreover, we found 
      cell-type-specific CREs are hotspots for phenotype-associated genetic variants and 
      were targeted by selection during modern maize breeding, highlighting the biological 
      implications of this CRE atlas. Through comparison of maize and Arabidopsis thaliana 
      developmental trajectories, we identified TFs and CREs with conserved and divergent 
      chromatin dynamics, showcasing extensive evolution of gene regulatory networks. In 
      addition to this rich dataset, we developed single-cell analysis software, Socrates, 
      which can be used to understand cis-regulatory variation in any species.

AB  - We explore the utility of bioengineered human tissues-individually or connected into 
      physiological units-for biological research. While much smaller and simpler than 
      their native counterparts, these tissues are complex enough to approximate distinct 
      tissue phenotypes: molecular, structural, and functional. Unlike organoids, which 
      form spontaneously and recapitulate development, "organs-on-a-chip" are engineered 
      to display some specific functions of whole organs. Looking back, we discuss the key 
      developments of this emerging technology. Thinking forward, we focus on the 
      challenges faced to fully establish, validate, and utilize the fidelity of these 
      models for biological research.

AB  - Our immune system has evolved to protect us from pathogens and maintain homeostasis 
      through localization in diverse tissue sites throughout the body. Immune responses 
      are orchestrated by T cells, which direct pathogen clearance at the infection site 
      and establish tissue-resident memory T cells (TRMs) for protection immunity. Here, 
      we discuss how tissue immune responses are influenced by various stressors (e.g., 
      metabolic, environmental, aging) that are rapidly changing due to climate 
      fluctuations and globalization. We propose potential strategies for targeting tissue 
      immunity to mitigate future pathogenic and environmental challenges and areas of 
      investigation that can elucidate mechanisms for adapting and restoring homeostasis.

AB  - Hendra (HeV) and Nipah (NiV) viruses are emerging zoonotic pathogens in the 
      Henipavirus genus causing outbreaks of disease with very high case fatality rates. 
      Here, we report the first naturally occurring human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 
      against HeV receptor binding protein (RBP). All isolated mAbs neutralized HeV, and 
      some also neutralized NiV. Epitope binning experiments identified five major 
      antigenic sites on HeV-RBP. Animal studies demonstrated that the most potent 
      cross-reactive neutralizing mAbs, HENV-26 and HENV-32, protected ferrets in lethal 
      models of infection with NiV Bangladesh 3 days after exposure. We solved the crystal 
      structures of mAb HENV-26 in complex with both HeV-RBP and NiV-RBP and of mAb 
      HENV-32 in complex with HeV-RBP. The studies reveal diverse sites of vulnerability 
      on RBP recognized by potent human mAbs that inhibit virus by multiple mechanisms. 
      These studies identify promising prophylactic antibodies and define protective 
      epitopes that can be used in rational vaccine design.

AB  - Vaccines are critical tools for maintaining global health. Traditional vaccine 
      technologies have been used across a wide range of bacterial and viral pathogens, 
      yet there are a number of examples where they have not been successful, such as for 
      persistent infections, rapidly evolving pathogens with high sequence variability, 
      complex viral antigens, and emerging pathogens. Novel technologies such as nucleic 
      acid and viral vector vaccines offer the potential to revolutionize vaccine 
      development as they are well-suited to address existing technology limitations. In 
      this review, we discuss the current state of RNA vaccines, recombinant adenovirus 
      vector-based vaccines, and advances from biomaterials and engineering that address 
      these important public health challenges.

AB  - Surface epithelia provide a critical barrier to the outside world. Upon a barrier 
      breach, resident epithelial and immune cells coordinate efforts to control 
      infections and heal tissue damage. Inflammation can etch lasting marks within 
      tissues, altering features such as scope and quality of future responses. By 
      remembering inflammatory experiences, tissues are better equipped to quickly and 
      robustly respond to barrier breaches. Alarmingly, in disease states, memory may fuel 
      the inflammatory fire. Here, we review the cellular communication networks in 
      barrier tissues and the integration between tissue-resident and recruited immune 
      cells and tissue stem cells underlying tissue adaptation to environmental stress.

AB  - The adaptive immune system is important for control of most viral infections. The 
      three fundamental components of the adaptive immune system are B cells (the source 
      of antibodies), CD4(+) T cells, and CD8(+) T cells. The armamentarium of B cells, 
      CD4(+) T cells, and CD8(+) T cells has differing roles in different viral infections 
      and in vaccines, and thus it is critical to directly study adaptive immunity to 
      SARS-CoV-2 to understand COVID-19. Knowledge is now available on relationships 
      between antigen-specific immune responses and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although more 
      studies are needed, a picture has begun to emerge that reveals that CD4(+) T cells, 
      CD8(+) T cells, and neutralizing antibodies all contribute to control of SARS-CoV-2 
      in both non-hospitalized and hospitalized cases of COVID-19. The specific functions 
      and kinetics of these adaptive immune responses are discussed, as well as their 
      interplay with innate immunity and implications for COVID-19 vaccines and immune 
      memory against re-infection.

AB  - Endometriosis is a common condition associated with infertility that causes chronic 
      pain in many, but not all, women. It is defined by the presence of endometrial-like 
      tissue outside the uterus. Although the cause and natural history of the disorder 
      remain uncertain, hormonal, neurological, and immunological factors are all 
      implicated in the mechanisms contributing to development of symptoms. Because 
      definitive diagnosis requires surgery, there is often a long diagnostic delay after 
      onset of symptoms. Current interventions for endometriosis have limited efficacy and 
      unacceptable side effects/risks and are associated with high rates of symptom 
      recurrence. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of the etiology of 
      endometriosis, discuss current diagnostic and treatment strategies, highlight 
      current clinical trials, and consider how recent results offer new avenues for the 
      identification of endometriosis biomarkers and the development of effective 
      non-surgical therapies that are fertility-sparing.

AB  - Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have revolutionized the treatment of several human 
      diseases, including cancer and autoimmunity and inflammatory conditions, and 
      represent a new frontier for the treatment of infectious diseases. In the last 20 
      years, innovative methods have allowed the rapid isolation of mAbs from convalescent 
      subjects, humanized mice, or libraries assembled in vitro and have proven that mAbs 
      can be effective countermeasures against emerging pathogens. During the past year, 
      an unprecedentedly large number of mAbs have been developed to fight coronavirus 
      disease 2019 (COVID-19). Lessons learned from this pandemic will pave the way for 
      the development of more mAb-based therapeutics for other infectious diseases. Here, 
      we provide an overview of SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing mAbs, including their origin, 
      specificity, structure, antiviral and immunological mechanisms of action, and 
      resistance to circulating variants, as well as a snapshot of the clinical trials of 
      approved or late-stage mAb therapeutics.

AB  - Clonal hematopoiesis, defined as the presence of expanded somatic blood cell clones, 
      is associated with about a doubling in the risk of coronary heart disease in humans. 
      Heyde and colleagues now provide evidence that clonal hematopoiesis results largely 
      from increased stem cell proliferation, which is, in turn, stimulated by 
      atherosclerosis.

AB  - The past year has underscored the threat that emerging viruses pose to global 
      health. The 2021 John Dirks Canada Gairdner Global Health award recognizes the 
      contributions of Joseph Sriyal Malik Peiris and Yi Guan toward understanding the 
      origins and options for control of newly emerging infectious disease outbreaks in 
      Asia, notably zoonotic influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). 
      Nicole Neuman of Cell corresponded with Malik Peiris about his path to studying 
      emerging infectious diseases and the challenges of this work. Excerpts of their 
      exchange are included here.

AB  - Genomically minimal cells, such as JCVI-syn3.0, offer a platform to clarify genes 
      underlying core physiological processes. Although this minimal cell includes genes 
      essential for population growth, the physiology of its single cells remained 
      uncharacterized. To investigate striking morphological variation in JCVI-syn3.0 
      cells, we present an approach to characterize cell propagation and determine genes 
      affecting cell morphology. Microfluidic chemostats allowed observation of intrinsic 
      cell dynamics that result in irregular morphologies. A genome with 19 genes not 
      retained in JCVI-syn3.0 generated JCVI-syn3A, which presents morphology similar to 
      that of JCVI-syn1.0. We further identified seven of these 19 genes, including two 
      known cell division genes, ftsZ and sepF, a hydrolase of unknown substrate, and four 
      genes that encode membrane-associated proteins of unknown function, which are 
      required together to restore a phenotype similar to that of JCVI-syn1.0. This result 
      emphasizes the polygenic nature of cell division and morphology in a genomically 
      minimal cell.

AB  - Mary-Claire King's approach to genetics has had a major impact on breast and ovarian 
      cancer and, more recently, mental illnesses including schizophrenia. Science writer 
      Kendall Morgan talked with Mary-Claire, recipient of a 2021 Canada Gairdner 
      International Award, about her life, her lengthy quest to discover the genetic basis 
      of susceptibility to breast cancer, the struggles for women in science, and much 
      more. An edited version of this conversation is presented below.

AB  - Animals have co-evolved with a vast diversity of microorganisms, collectively named 
      the microbiome, which are important modulators of host gastrointestinal, immune, 
      metabolic, and behavioral functions. In this SnapShot, we provide an overview of the 
      neurodevelopmental and functional influence of host-microbial interactions in the 
      "microbiota-gut-brain axis," which refers to the bidirectional communication between 
      the central nervous system and the gastrointestinal microbiome. To view this

AB  - Genetic studies have revealed many variant loci that are associated with 
      immune-mediated diseases. To elucidate the disease pathogenesis, it is essential to 
      understand the function of these variants, especially under disease-associated 
      conditions. Here, we performed a large-scale immune cell gene-expression analysis, 
      together with whole-genome sequence analysis. Our dataset consists of 28 distinct 
      immune cell subsets from 337 patients diagnosed with 10 categories of 
      immune-mediated diseases and 79 healthy volunteers. Our dataset captured distinctive 
      gene-expression profiles across immune cell types and diseases. Expression 
      quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis revealed dynamic variations of eQTL effects 
      in the context of immunological conditions, as well as cell types. These 
      cell-type-specific and context-dependent eQTLs showed significant enrichment in 
      immune disease-associated genetic variants, and they implicated the 
      disease-relevant cell types, genes, and environment. This atlas deepens our 
      understanding of the immunogenetic functions of disease-associated variants under 
      in vivo disease conditions.

AB  - In this issue of Cell, McDonald et al. show that giant multinucleated, 
      bone-resorbing osteoclasts dissolve into smaller cells, termed "osteopmorhs," which 
      re-form into osteoclasts at distal bone sites (McDonald et al., 2021). These 
      findings overturn the long-standing premise that osteoclasts differentiate solely 
      from hematopoietic precursors and undergo apoptosis after completing resorption.

AB  - Measuring scientific success has traditionally involved numbers and statistics. 
      However, due to an increasingly uncertain world, more than ever we need to measure 
      the effect that science has on real-world scenarios. We asked researchers to share 
      their points of view on what scientific impact means to them and how impact matters 
      beyond the numbers.

AB  - All of science takes place amidst a world shaken by uncertainty, social and 
      political upheaval, and challenges to truthful testimony. Just at the moment in 
      which increasing control over biology has been theorized, our social world has 
      become increasingly contentious and its values more divisive. Using the example of 
      gene drives for malaria control to explore the problem of deep uncertainty in 
      biomedical research, I argue that profound uncertainty is an essential feature. 
      Applying the language and presumptions of the discipline of philosophical ethics, I 
      describe three types of uncertainty that raise ethical challenges in scientific 
      research. Rather than mitigate these challenges with excessive precautions and 
      limits on progress, I suggest that researchers can cultivate classic values of 
      veracity, courage, humility, and fidelity in their research allowing science to 
      proceed ethically under conditions of deep uncertainty.

AB  - Memory B cells play a fundamental role in host defenses against viruses, but to 
      date, their role has been relatively unsettled in the context of SARS-CoV-2. We 
      report here a longitudinal single-cell and repertoire profiling of the B cell 
      response up to 6 months in mild and severe COVID-19 patients. Distinct SARS-CoV-2 
      spike-specific activated B cell clones fueled an early antibody-secreting cell burst 
      as well as a durable synchronous germinal center response. While highly mutated 
      memory B cells, including pre-existing cross-reactive seasonal 
      Betacoronavirus-specific clones, were recruited early in the response, neutralizing 
      SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific clones accumulated with time and largely contributed to the 
      late, remarkably stable, memory B cell pool. Highlighting germinal center 
      maturation, these cells displayed clear accumulation of somatic mutations in their 
      variable region genes over time. Overall, these findings demonstrate that an 
      antigen-driven activation persisted and matured up to 6 months after SARS-CoV-2 
      infection and may provide long-term protection.

AB  - The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
      variants that escape convalescent and vaccine-induced antibody responses has renewed 
      focus on the development of broadly protective T-cell-based vaccines. Here, we apply 
      structure-based network analysis and assessments of HLA class I peptide stability to 
      define mutationally constrained CD8(+) T cell epitopes across the SARS-CoV-2 
      proteome. Highly networked residues are conserved temporally among circulating 
      variants and sarbecoviruses and disproportionately impair spike pseudotyped 
      lentivirus infectivity when mutated. Evaluation of HLA class I stabilizing activity 
      for 18 globally prevalent alleles identifies CD8(+) T cell epitopes within highly 
      networked regions with limited mutational frequencies in circulating SARS-CoV-2 
      variants and deep-sequenced primary isolates. Moreover, these epitopes elicit 
      demonstrable CD8(+) T cell reactivity in convalescent individuals but reduced 
      recognition in recipients of mRNA-based vaccines. These data thereby elucidate key 
      mutationally constrained regions and immunogenic epitopes in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome 
      for a global T-cell-based vaccine against emerging variants and SARS-like 
      coronaviruses.

AB  - Cytomegaloviruses (CMVs) have co-evolved with their mammalian hosts for millions of 
      years, leading to remarkable host specificity and high infection prevalence. 
      Macrophages, which already populate barrier tissues in the embryo, are the 
      predominant immune cells at potential CMV entry sites. Here we show that, upon CMV 
      infection, macrophages undergo a morphological, immunophenotypic, and metabolic 
      transformation process with features of stemness, altered migration, enhanced 
      invasiveness, and provision of the cell cycle machinery for viral proliferation. 
      This complex process depends on Wnt signaling and the transcription factor ZEB1. In 
      pulmonary infection, mouse CMV primarily targets and reprograms alveolar 
      macrophages, which alters lung physiology and facilitates primary CMV and secondary 
      bacterial infection by attenuating the inflammatory response. Thus, CMV profoundly 
      perturbs macrophage identity beyond established limits of plasticity and rewires 
      specific differentiation processes, allowing viral spread and impairing innate 
      tissue immunity.

AB  - The simultaneous measurement of multiple modalities represents an exciting frontier 
      for single-cell genomics and necessitates computational methods that can define 
      cellular states based on multimodal data. Here, we introduce "weighted-nearest 
      neighbor" analysis, an unsupervised framework to learn the relative utility of each 
      data type in each cell, enabling an integrative analysis of multiple modalities. We 
      apply our procedure to a CITE-seq dataset of 211,000 human peripheral blood 
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with panels extending to 228 antibodies to construct a 
      multimodal reference atlas of the circulating immune system. Multimodal analysis 
      substantially improves our ability to resolve cell states, allowing us to identify 
      and validate previously unreported lymphoid subpopulations. Moreover, we demonstrate 
      how to leverage this reference to rapidly map new datasets and to interpret immune 
      responses to vaccination and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our approach 
      represents a broadly applicable strategy to analyze single-cell multimodal datasets 
      and to look beyond the transcriptome toward a unified and multimodal definition of 
      cellular identity.

AB  - Humans have an extraordinarily expanded and complex cerebral cortex, relative to 
      non-human primates. Yet the mechanisms underlying cortical differences across 
      evolution are unclear. A new study by Benito-Kwiecinski et al. employs cerebral 
      organoids derived across great apes to implicate neuroepithelial progenitor shape 
      transitions in human cortical expansion.

AB  - Reinventing potato from a clonally propagated tetraploid into a seed-propagated 
      diploid, hybrid potato, is an important innovation in agriculture. Due to 
      deleterious mutations, it has remained a challenge to develop highly homozygous 
      inbred lines, a prerequisite to breed hybrid potato. Here, we employed genome design 
      to develop a generation of pure and fertile potato lines and thereby the uniform, 
      vigorous F(1)s. The metrics we applied in genome design included the percentage of 
      genome homozygosity and the number of deleterious mutations in the starting 
      material, the number of segregation distortions in the S(1) population, the 
      haplotype information to infer the break of tight linkage between beneficial and 
      deleterious alleles, and the genome complementarity of the parental lines. This 
      study transforms potato breeding from a slow, non-accumulative mode into a 
      fast-iterative one, thereby potentiating a broad spectrum of benefits to farmers and 
      consumers.

AB  - Individual neurons in visual cortex provide the brain with unreliable estimates of 
      visual features. It is not known whether the single-neuron variability is correlated 
      across large neural populations, thus impairing the global encoding of stimuli. We 
      recorded simultaneously from up to 50,000 neurons in mouse primary visual cortex 
      (V1) and in higher order visual areas and measured stimulus discrimination 
      thresholds of 0.35° and 0.37°, respectively, in an orientation decoding task. These 
      neural thresholds were almost 100 times smaller than the behavioral discrimination 
      thresholds reported in mice. This discrepancy could not be explained by stimulus 
      properties or arousal states. Furthermore, behavioral variability during a sensory 
      discrimination task could not be explained by neural variability in V1. Instead, 
      behavior-related neural activity arose dynamically across a network of non-sensory 
      brain areas. These results imply that perceptual discrimination in mice is limited 
      by downstream decoders, not by neural noise in sensory representations.

AB  - Clear cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC) is a heterogeneous disease with a variable 
      post-surgical course. To assemble a comprehensive ccRCC tumor microenvironment (TME) 
      atlas, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of hematopoietic and 
      non-hematopoietic subpopulations from tumor and tumor-adjacent tissue of 
      treatment-naive ccRCC resections. We leveraged the VIPER algorithm to quantitate 
      single-cell protein activity and validated this approach by comparison to flow 
      cytometry. The analysis identified key TME subpopulations, as well as their master 
      regulators and candidate cell-cell interactions, revealing clinically relevant 
      populations, undetectable by gene-expression analysis. Specifically, we uncovered a 
      tumor-specific macrophage subpopulation characterized by upregulation of 
      TREM2/APOE/C1Q, validated by spatially resolved, quantitative multispectral 
      immunofluorescence. In a large clinical validation cohort, these markers were 
      significantly enriched in tumors from patients who recurred following surgery. The 
      study thus identifies TREM2/APOE/C1Q-positive macrophage infiltration as a potential 
      prognostic biomarker for ccRCC recurrence, as well as a candidate therapeutic 
      target.

AB  - Many scientists spend unnecessary time reformatting papers to submit them to 
      different journals. We propose a uniform submission format that we hope journals 
      will include in their options for submission. Widespread adoption of this uniform 
      submission format could shorten the submission and publishing process, freeing up 
      time for research.

AB  - Organs are composed of diverse cell types that traverse transient states during 
      organogenesis. To interrogate this diversity during human development, we generate a 
      single-cell transcriptome atlas from multiple developing endodermal organs of the 
      respiratory and gastrointestinal tract. We illuminate cell states, transcription 
      factors, and organ-specific epithelial stem cell and mesenchyme interactions across 
      lineages. We implement the atlas as a high-dimensional search space to benchmark 
      human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived intestinal organoids (HIOs) under 
      multiple culture conditions. We show that HIOs recapitulate reference cell states 
      and use HIOs to reconstruct the molecular dynamics of intestinal epithelium and 
      mesenchyme emergence. We show that the mesenchyme-derived niche cue NRG1 enhances 
      intestinal stem cell maturation in vitro and that the homeobox transcription factor 
      CDX2 is required for regionalization of intestinal epithelium and mesenchyme in 
      humans. This work combines cell atlases and organoid technologies to understand how 
      human organ development is orchestrated.

AB  - The recently enriched genomic history of Indigenous groups in the Americas is still 
      meager concerning continental Central America. Here, we report ten pre-Hispanic 
      (plus two early colonial) genomes and 84 genome-wide profiles from seven groups 
      presently living in Panama. Our analyses reveal that pre-Hispanic demographic events 
      contributed to the extensive genetic structure currently seen in the area, which is 
      also characterized by a distinctive Isthmo-Colombian Indigenous component. This 
      component drives these populations on a specific variability axis and derives from 
      the local admixture of different ancestries of northern North American origin(s). 
      Two of these ancestries were differentially associated to Pleistocene Indigenous 
      groups that also moved into South America, leaving heterogenous genetic footprints. 
      An additional Pleistocene ancestry was brought by a still unsampled population of 
      the Isthmus (UPopI) that remained restricted to the Isthmian area, expanded locally 
      during the early Holocene, and left genomic traces up to the present day.

AB  - The population is aging at a rate never seen before in human history. As the number 
      of elderly adults grows, it is imperative we expand our understanding of the 
      underpinnings of aging biology. Human lungs are composed of a unique panoply of cell 
      types that face ongoing chemical, mechanical, biological, immunological, and 
      xenobiotic stress over a lifetime. Yet, we do not fully appreciate the mechanistic 
      drivers of lung aging and why age increases the risk of parenchymal lung disease, 
      fatal respiratory infection, and primary lung cancer. Here, we review the molecular 
      and cellular aspects of lung aging, local stress response pathways, and how the 
      aging process predisposes to the pathogenesis of pulmonary disease. We place these 
      insights into context of the COVID-19 pandemic and discuss how innate and adaptive 
      immunity within the lung is altered with age.

AB  - Fibroblasts are diverse mesenchymal cells that participate in tissue homeostasis and 
      disease by producing complex extracellular matrix and creating signaling niches 
      through biophysical and biochemical cues. Transcriptionally and functionally 
      heterogeneous across and within organs, fibroblasts encode regional positional 
      information and maintain distinct cellular progeny. We summarize their development, 
      lineages, functions, and contributions to fibrosis in four fibroblast-rich organs: 
      skin, lung, skeletal muscle, and heart. We propose that fibroblasts are uniquely 
      poised for tissue repair by easily reentering the cell cycle and exhibiting a 
      reversible plasticity in phenotype and cell fate. These properties, when activated 
      aberrantly, drive fibrotic disorders in humans.

AB  - Neonates are born with an immature immune system and rely on the transfer of 
      immunity from their mothers. Maternal antibodies are transferred via the placenta 
      and breast milk. Although the role of placentally transferred immunoglobulin G (IgG) 
      is established, less is known about the selection of antibodies transferred via 
      breast milk and the mechanisms by which they provide protection against neonatal 
      disease. Evidence suggests that breast milk antibodies play multifaceted roles, 
      preventing infection and supporting the selection of commensals and tolerizing 
      immunity during infancy. Here, we discuss emerging data related to the importance of 
      breast milk antibodies in neonatal immunity and development.

AB  - The molecular pathology of multi-organ injuries in COVID-19 patients remains 
      unclear, preventing effective therapeutics development. Here, we report a proteomic 
      analysis of 144 autopsy samples from seven organs in 19 COVID-19 patients. We 
      quantified 11,394 proteins in these samples, in which 5,336 were perturbed in the 
      COVID-19 patients compared to controls. Our data showed that cathepsin L1, rather 
      than ACE2, was significantly upregulated in the lung from the COVID-19 patients. 
      Systemic hyperinflammation and dysregulation of glucose and fatty acid metabolism 
      were detected in multiple organs. We also observed dysregulation of key factors 
      involved in hypoxia, angiogenesis, blood coagulation, and fibrosis in multiple 
      organs from the COVID-19 patients. Evidence for testicular injuries includes reduced 
      Leydig cells, suppressed cholesterol biosynthesis, and sperm mobility. In summary, 
      this study depicts a multi-organ proteomic landscape of COVID-19 autopsies that 
      furthers our understanding of the biological basis of COVID-19 pathology.

AB  - The use of opioid drugs and related overdose deaths, which rose to epidemic 
      proportions over the past decade, have been exacerbated by the COVID pandemic, a 
      time of great uncertainty and isolation. Much is known about opioid pharmacology and 
      related neural circuits that, combined with novel emerging neurobiological insights, 
      can help guide new treatment strategies. To view this SnapShot, open or download the

AB  - Historically, emerging viruses appear constantly and have cost millions of human 
      lives. Currently, climate change and intense globalization have created favorable 
      conditions for viral transmission. Therefore, effective antivirals, especially those 
      targeting the conserved protein in multiple unrelated viruses, such as the compounds 
      targeting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, are urgently needed to combat more emerging 
      and re-emerging viruses in the future. Here we reviewed the development of 
      antivirals with common targets, including those against the same protein across 
      viruses, or the same viral function, to provide clues for development of antivirals 
      for future epidemics.

AB  - Plant species have evolved myriads of solutions, including complex cell type 
      development and regulation, to adapt to dynamic environments. To understand this 
      cellular diversity, we profiled tomato root cell type translatomes. Using xylem 
      differentiation in tomato, examples of functional innovation, repurposing, and 
      conservation of transcription factors are described, relative to the model plant 
      Arabidopsis. Repurposing and innovation of genes are further observed within an 
      exodermis regulatory network and illustrate its function. Comparative translatome 
      analyses of rice, tomato, and Arabidopsis cell populations suggest increased 
      expression conservation of root meristems compared with other homologous 
      populations. In addition, the functions of constitutively expressed genes are more 
      conserved than those of cell type/tissue-enriched genes. These observations suggest 
      that higher order properties of cell type and pan-cell type regulation are 
      evolutionarily conserved between plants and animals.

AB  - Tn7-like transposons have co-opted CRISPR systems, including class 1 type I-F, I-B, 
      and class 2 type V-K. Intriguingly, although these CRISPR-associated transposases 
      (CASTs) undergo robust CRISPR RNA (crRNA)-guided transposition, they are almost 
      never found in sites targeted by the crRNAs encoded by the cognate CRISPR array. To 
      understand this paradox, we investigated CAST V-K and I-B systems and found two 
      distinct modes of transposition: (1) crRNA-guided transposition and (2) CRISPR 
      array-independent homing. We show distinct CAST systems utilize different molecular 
      mechanisms to target their homing site. Type V-K CAST systems use a short, 
      delocalized crRNA for RNA-guided homing, whereas type I-B CAST systems, which 
      contain two distinct target selector proteins, use TniQ for RNA-guided DNA 
      transposition and TnsD for homing to an attachment site. These observations 
      illuminate a key step in the life cycle of CAST systems and highlight the diversity 
      of molecular mechanisms mediating transposon homing.

AB  - Diet modulates the gut microbiome, which in turn can impact the immune system. Here, 
      we determined how two microbiota-targeted dietary interventions, plant-based fiber 
      and fermented foods, influence the human microbiome and immune system in healthy 
      adults. Using a 17-week randomized, prospective study (n = 18/arm) combined with 
      -omics measurements of microbiome and host, including extensive immune profiling, we 
      found diet-specific effects. The high-fiber diet increased microbiome-encoded 
      glycan-degrading carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes) despite stable microbial 
      community diversity. Although cytokine response score (primary outcome) was 
      unchanged, three distinct immunological trajectories in high-fiber consumers 
      corresponded to baseline microbiota diversity. Alternatively, the 
      high-fermented-food diet steadily increased microbiota diversity and decreased 
      inflammatory markers. The data highlight how coupling dietary interventions to deep 
      and longitudinal immune and microbiome profiling can provide individualized and 
      population-wide insight. Fermented foods may be valuable in countering the decreased 
      microbiome diversity and increased inflammation pervasive in industrialized society.

AB  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the leading chronic liver disease 
      worldwide. Its more advanced subtype, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), connotes 
      progressive liver injury that can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. 
      Here we provide an in-depth discussion of the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms 
      that lead to progressive liver injury, including the metabolic origins of NAFLD, the

AB  - Feeding the ever-growing population is a major challenge, especially in light of 
      rapidly changing climate conditions. Genome editing is set to revolutionize plant 
      breeding and could help secure the global food supply. Here, I review the 
      development and application of genome editing tools in plants while highlighting 
      newly developed techniques. I describe new plant breeding strategies based on genome 
      editing and discuss their impact on crop production, with an emphasis on recent 
      advancements in genome editing-based plant improvements that could not be achieved 
      by conventional breeding. I also discuss challenges facing genome editing that must 
      be overcome before realizing the full potential of this technology toward future 
      crops and food production.

AB  - How are individual cell behaviors coordinated toward invariant large-scale 
      anatomical outcomes in development and regeneration despite unpredictable 
      perturbations? Endogenous distributions of membrane potentials, produced by ion 
      channels and gap junctions, are present across all tissues. These bioelectrical 
      networks process morphogenetic information that controls gene expression, enabling 
      cell collectives to make decisions about large-scale growth and form. Recent 
      progress in the analysis and computational modeling of developmental bioelectric 
      circuits and channelopathies reveals how cellular collectives cooperate toward 
      organ-level structural order. These advances suggest a roadmap for exploiting 
      bioelectric signaling for interventions addressing developmental disorders, 
      regenerative medicine, cancer reprogramming, and synthetic bioengineering.

AB  - The spread of scientific misinformation is not new but rather has long posed threats 
      to human health, environmental well-being, and the creation of a sustainable and 
      equitable future. However, with the COVID-19 pandemic, the need to develop 
      strategies to counteract scientific misinformation has taken on an acute urgency. 
      Cell editor Nicole Neuman sat down with Walter Quattrociocchi and Dietram Scheufele 
      to gain insights on how we got here and what does-and does not-work to fight the 
      spread of scientific misinformation. Excerpts from this conversation, edited for 
      clarity and length, are presented below, and the full conversation is available with 
      the article online.

AB  - The introduction of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
      into the human population represents a tremendous medical and economic crisis. 
      Innate immunity-as the first line of defense of our immune system-plays a central 
      role in combating this novel virus. Here, we provide a conceptual framework for the 
      interaction of the human innate immune system with SARS-CoV-2 to link the clinical 
      observations with experimental findings that have been made during the first year of 
      the pandemic. We review evidence that variability in innate immune system components 
      among humans is a main contributor to the heterogeneous disease courses observed for 
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the disease spectrum induced by SARS-CoV-2. A 
      better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms observed for cells and 
      soluble mediators involved in innate immunity is a prerequisite for the development 
      of diagnostic markers and therapeutic strategies targeting COVID-19. However, this 
      will also require additional studies addressing causality of events, which so far 
      are lagging behind.

AB  - Education of the human immune system begins in utero via T cell activation and 
      memory development. However, whether part of the education is provided by exposure 
      to microbes in utero remains controversial and unclear. In this issue of Cell, 
      Mishra et al. provide new evidence that the fetal gut may be colonized by bacteria 
      that prime T cell memories.

AB  - Clonal hematopoiesis, a condition in which individual hematopoietic stem cell clones 
      generate a disproportionate fraction of blood leukocytes, correlates with higher 
      risk for cardiovascular disease. The mechanisms behind this association are 
      incompletely understood. Here, we show that hematopoietic stem cell division rates 
      are increased in mice and humans with atherosclerosis. Mathematical analysis 
      demonstrates that increased stem cell proliferation expedites somatic evolution and 
      expansion of clones with driver mutations. The experimentally determined division 
      rate elevation in atherosclerosis patients is sufficient to produce a 3.5-fold 
      increased risk of clonal hematopoiesis by age 70. We confirm the accuracy of our 
      theoretical framework in mouse models of atherosclerosis and sleep fragmentation by 
      showing that expansion of competitively transplanted Tet2(-/-) cells is accelerated 
      under conditions of chronically elevated hematopoietic activity. Hence, increased 
      hematopoietic stem cell proliferation is an important factor contributing to the 
      association between cardiovascular disease and clonal hematopoiesis.

AB  - The events of the past year have underscored the serious and rapid threat that 
      emerging viruses pose to global health. However, much of the rapid progress in 
      understanding and combating SARS-CoV-2 was made possible because of the decades of 
      important groundwork laid from researchers studying other emergent infectious 
      diseases. The 2021 John Dirks Canada Gairdner Global Health award recognizes the 
      contributions of Joseph Sriyal Malik Peiris and Yi Guan toward understanding the 
      origins and options for control of newly emerging infectious disease outbreaks in 
      Asia, notably zoonotic influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). 
      Cell's Nicole Neuman corresponded with Yi Guan about his path to becoming a viral 
      infection sleuth and the challenges of understanding emerging pathogens and their 
      origins. Excerpts of their exchange are included here.

AB  - Damaged mitochondria need to be cleared to maintain the quality of the mitochondrial 
      pool. Here, we report mitocytosis, a migrasome-mediated mitochondrial 
      quality-control process. We found that, upon exposure to mild mitochondrial 
      stresses, damaged mitochondria are transported into migrasomes and subsequently 
      disposed of from migrating cells. Mechanistically, mitocytosis requires positioning 
      of damaged mitochondria at the cell periphery, which occurs because damaged 
      mitochondria avoid binding to inward motor proteins. Functionally, mitocytosis plays 
      an important role in maintaining mitochondrial quality. Enhanced mitocytosis 
      protects cells from mitochondrial stressor-induced loss of mitochondrial membrane 
      potential (MMP) and mitochondrial respiration; conversely, blocking mitocytosis 
      causes loss of MMP and mitochondrial respiration under normal conditions. 
      Physiologically, we demonstrate that mitocytosis is required for maintaining MMP and 
      viability in neutrophils in vivo. We propose that mitocytosis is an important 
      mitochondrial quality-control process in migrating cells, which couples 
      mitochondrial homeostasis with cell migration.

      control of many aspects of protein biosynthesis and degradation. Through the 
      concerted action of specialized stress sensors, the proteostasis network monitors 
      and limits the accumulation of damaged, misfolded, or aggregated proteins. These 
      stress pathways signal to the cytosol and nucleus to reprogram gene expression, 
      enabling adaptive programs to recover cell function. During aging, the activity of 
      the proteostasis network declines, which may increase the risk of accumulating 
      abnormal protein aggregates, a hallmark of most neurodegenerative diseases. Here, I 
      discuss emerging concepts illustrating the functional significance of adaptive 
      signaling pathways to normal brain physiology and their contribution to age-related 
      disorders. Pharmacological and gene therapy strategies to intervene and boost 
      proteostasis are expected to extend brain healthspan and ameliorate disease states.

AB  - Emerging tissue transformation technologies provide an unprecedented opportunity to 
      investigate system-level molecular and anatomical features in situ. Hydrogel-based 
      methods engineer physicochemical tissue properties to render intact organs optically 
      transparent and size and shape adjustable while preserving biomolecules at their 
      physiological locations. When combined with advanced molecular tools, labeling, and 
      imaging techniques, tissue transformation enables three-dimensional (3D) mapping of 
      molecules, cells, and their interrelationships at increasing speeds and resolutions. 
      In this review, we discuss the basic engineering principles of tissue transformation 
      and labeling techniques as well as their broad applications, current challenges, and 
      future potential.

AB  - Synthetic biology is a design-driven discipline centered on engineering novel 
      biological functions through the discovery, characterization, and repurposing of 
      molecular parts. Several synthetic biological solutions to critical biomedical 
      problems are on the verge of widespread adoption and demonstrate the burgeoning 
      maturation of the field. Here, we highlight applications of synthetic biology in 
      vaccine development, molecular diagnostics, and cell-based therapeutics, emphasizing 
      technologies approved for clinical use or in active clinical trials. We conclude by 
      drawing attention to recent innovations in synthetic biology that are likely to have 
      a significant impact on future applications in biomedicine.

AB  - During the past decade, immunotherapies have made a major impact on the treatment of 
      diverse types of cancer. Inflammatory toxicities are not only a major concern for 
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved checkpoint blockade and chimeric antigen 
      receptor (CAR) T cell therapies, but also limit the development and use of 
      combination therapies. Fundamentally, these adverse events highlight the intricate 
      balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways that regulate protective immune 
      responses. Here, we discuss the cellular and molecular mechanisms of inflammatory 
      adverse events, current approaches to treatment, as well as opportunities for the 
      design of immunotherapies that limit such inflammatory toxicities while preserving 
      anti-tumor efficacy.

AB  - In this issue of Cell, Casanova and colleagues examine three family members with a 
      mutation that results in deficiency of the T cell co-stimulatory molecule CD28. 
      These patients exhibit clinical symptoms due to human papillomavirus-2 and -4 
      infections, show increased levels of Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus in the 
      blood, and respond poorly to vaccines.

AB  - The Middle East region is important to understand human evolution and migrations but 
      is underrepresented in genomic studies. Here, we generated 137 high-coverage 
      physically phased genome sequences from eight Middle Eastern populations using 
      linked-read sequencing. We found no genetic traces of early expansions out-of-Africa 
      in present-day populations but found Arabians have elevated Basal Eurasian ancestry 
      that dilutes their Neanderthal ancestry. Population sizes within the region started 
      diverging 15-20 kya, when Levantines expanded while Arabians maintained smaller 
      populations that derived ancestry from local hunter-gatherers. Arabians suffered a 
      population bottleneck around the aridification of Arabia 6 kya, while Levantines had 
      a distinct bottleneck overlapping the 4.2 kya aridification event. We found an 
      association between movement and admixture of populations in the region and the 
      spread of Semitic languages. Finally, we identify variants that show evidence of 
      selection, including polygenic selection. Our results provide detailed insights into 
      the genomic and selective histories of the Middle East.

AB  - The past decade has witnessed the emergence of highly sophisticated vaccines; still 
      their mechanism of action is not fully understood. Wimmers et al. use advanced 
      techniques to evaluate the immune landscape induced by flu vaccines and show that 
      their effect on the immune system can last even 6 months from administration.

AB  - Cellular processes arise from the dynamic organization of proteins in networks of 
      physical interactions. Mapping the interactome has therefore been a central 
      objective of high-throughput biology. However, the dynamics of protein interactions 
      across physiological contexts remain poorly understood. Here, we develop a 
      quantitative proteomic approach combining protein correlation profiling with stable 
      isotope labeling of mammals (PCP-SILAM) to map the interactomes of seven mouse 
      tissues. The resulting maps provide a proteome-scale survey of interactome rewiring 
      across mammalian tissues, revealing more than 125,000 unique interactions at a 
      quality comparable to the highest-quality human screens. We identify systematic 
      suppression of cross-talk between the evolutionarily ancient housekeeping 
      interactome and younger, tissue-specific modules. Rewired proteins are tightly 
      regulated by multiple cellular mechanisms and are implicated in disease. Our study 
      opens up new avenues to uncover regulatory mechanisms that shape in vivo interactome 
      responses to physiological and pathophysiological stimuli in mammalian systems.

AB  - The fin-to-limb transition has long fascinated evolutionary biologists, but a 
      unifying theory as to its developmental origins has remained elusive. New work by 
      Hawkins and colleagues demonstrates the surprising potential of teleost fins to 
      exhibit a Hox-regulated limb-like skeletal pattern, shedding new light on the 
      evolution of proximo-distal patterning processes.

AB  - Bacteriophages drive evolutionary change in bacterial communities by creating gene 
      flow networks that fuel ecological adaptions. However, the extent of viral diversity 
      and its prevalence in the human gut remains largely unknown. Here, we introduce the 
      Gut Phage Database, a collection of ∼142,000 non-redundant viral genomes (>10 kb) 
      obtained by mining a dataset of 28,060 globally distributed human gut metagenomes 
      and 2,898 reference genomes of cultured gut bacteria. Host assignment revealed that 
      viral diversity is highest in the Firmicutes phyla and that ∼36% of viral clusters 
      (VCs) are not restricted to a single species, creating gene flow networks across 
      phylogenetically distinct bacterial species. Epidemiological analysis uncovered 280 
      globally distributed VCs found in at least 5 continents and a highly prevalent phage 
      clade with features reminiscent of p-crAssphage. This high-quality, large-scale 
      catalog of phage genomes will improve future virome studies and enable ecological 
      and evolutionary analysis of human gut bacteriophages.

AB  - Metastasis has been considered as the terminal step of tumor progression. However, 
      recent genomic studies suggest that many metastases are initiated by further spread 
      of other metastases. Nevertheless, the corresponding pre-clinical models are 
      lacking, and underlying mechanisms are elusive. Using several approaches, including 
      parabiosis and an evolving barcode system, we demonstrated that the bone 
      microenvironment facilitates breast and prostate cancer cells to further metastasize 
      and establish multi-organ secondary metastases. We uncovered that this 
      metastasis-promoting effect is driven by epigenetic reprogramming that confers stem 
      cell-like properties on cancer cells disseminated from bone lesions. Furthermore, we 
      discovered that enhanced EZH2 activity mediates the increased stemness and 
      metastasis capacity. The same findings also apply to single cell-derived 
      populations, indicating mechanisms distinct from clonal selection. Taken together, 
      our work revealed an unappreciated role of the bone microenvironment in metastasis 
      evolution and elucidated an epigenomic reprogramming process driving terminal-stage, 
      multi-organ metastases.

AB  - Thousands of interactions assemble proteins into modules that impart spatial and 
      functional organization to the cellular proteome. Through affinity-purification mass 
      spectrometry, we have created two proteome-scale, cell-line-specific interaction 
      networks. The first, BioPlex 3.0, results from affinity purification of 10,128 human 
      proteins-half the proteome-in 293T cells and includes 118,162 interactions among 
      14,586 proteins. The second results from 5,522 immunoprecipitations in HCT116 cells. 
      These networks model the interactome whose structure encodes protein function, 
      localization, and complex membership. Comparison across cell lines validates 
      thousands of interactions and reveals extensive customization. Whereas shared 
      interactions reside in core complexes and involve essential proteins, cell-specific 
      interactions link these complexes, "rewiring" subnetworks within each cell's 
      interactome. Interactions covary among proteins of shared function as the proteome 
      remodels to produce each cell's phenotype. Viewable interactively online through 
      BioPlexExplorer, these networks define principles of proteome organization and 
      enable unknown protein characterization.

AB  - To investigate circuit mechanisms underlying locomotor behavior, we used 
      serial-section electron microscopy (EM) to acquire a synapse-resolution dataset 
      containing the ventral nerve cord (VNC) of an adult female Drosophila melanogaster. 
      To generate this dataset, we developed GridTape, a technology that combines 
      automated serial-section collection with automated high-throughput transmission EM. 
      Using this dataset, we studied neuronal networks that control leg and wing movements 
      by reconstructing all 507 motor neurons that control the limbs. We show that a 
      specific class of leg sensory neurons synapses directly onto motor neurons with the 
      largest-caliber axons on both sides of the body, representing a unique pathway for 
      fast limb control. We provide open access to the dataset and reconstructions 
      registered to a standard atlas to permit matching of cells between EM and light 
      microscopy data. We also provide GridTape instrumentation designs and software to 
      make large-scale EM more accessible and affordable to the scientific community.

AB  - We have produced gene expression profiles of all 302 neurons of the C. elegans 
      nervous system that match the single-cell resolution of its anatomy and wiring 
      diagram. Our results suggest that individual neuron classes can be solely identified 
      by combinatorial expression of specific gene families. For example, each neuron 
      class expresses distinct codes of ∼23 neuropeptide genes and ∼36 neuropeptide 
      receptors, delineating a complex and expansive "wireless" signaling network. To 
      demonstrate the utility of this comprehensive gene expression catalog, we used 
      computational approaches to (1) identify cis-regulatory elements for neuron-specific 
      gene expression and (2) reveal adhesion proteins with potential roles in process 
      placement and synaptic specificity. Our expression data are available at 
      https://cengen.org and can be interrogated at the web application CengenApp. We 
      expect that this neuron-specific directory of gene expression will spur 
      investigations of underlying mechanisms that define anatomy, connectivity, and 
      function throughout the C. elegans nervous system.

AB  - Ligands can induce G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to adopt a myriad of 
      conformations, many of which play critical roles in determining the activation of 
      specific signaling cascades associated with distinct functional and behavioral 
      consequences. For example, the 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) is the 
      target of classic hallucinogens, atypical antipsychotics, and psychoplastogens. 
      However, currently available methods are inadequate for directly assessing 5-HT2AR 
      conformation both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we developed psychLight, a genetically 
      encoded fluorescent sensor based on the 5-HT2AR structure. PsychLight detects 
      behaviorally relevant serotonin release and correctly predicts the hallucinogenic 
      behavioral effects of structurally similar 5-HT2AR ligands. We further used 
      psychLight to identify a non-hallucinogenic psychedelic analog, which produced 
      rapid-onset and long-lasting antidepressant-like effects after a single 
      administration. The advent of psychLight will enable in vivo detection of serotonin 
      dynamics, early identification of designer drugs of abuse, and the development of 
      5-HT2AR-dependent non-hallucinogenic therapeutics.

AB  - Animal bodies are composed of cell types with unique expression programs that 
      implement their distinct locations, shapes, structures, and functions. Based on 
      these properties, cell types assemble into specific tissues and organs. To 
      systematically explore the link between cell-type-specific gene expression and 
      morphology, we registered an expression atlas to a whole-body electron microscopy 
      volume of the nereid Platynereis dumerilii. Automated segmentation of cells and 
      nuclei identifies major cell classes and establishes a link between gene activation, 
      chromatin topography, and nuclear size. Clustering of segmented cells according to 
      gene expression reveals spatially coherent tissues. In the brain, genetically 
      defined groups of neurons match ganglionic nuclei with coherent projections. Besides 
      interneurons, we uncover sensory-neurosecretory cells in the nereid mushroom bodies, 
      which thus qualify as sensory organs. They furthermore resemble the vertebrate 
      telencephalon by molecular anatomy. We provide an integrated browser as a Fiji 
      plugin for remote exploration of all available multimodal datasets.

AB  - The Cycladic, the Minoan, and the Helladic (Mycenaean) cultures define the Bronze 
      Age (BA) of Greece. Urbanism, complex social structures, craft and agricultural 
      specialization, and the earliest forms of writing characterize this iconic period. 
      We sequenced six Early to Middle BA whole genomes, along with 11 mitochondrial 
      genomes, sampled from the three BA cultures of the Aegean Sea. The Early BA (EBA) 
      genomes are homogeneous and derive most of their ancestry from Neolithic Aegeans, 
      contrary to earlier hypotheses that the Neolithic-EBA cultural transition was due to 
      massive population turnover. EBA Aegeans were shaped by relatively small-scale 
      migration from East of the Aegean, as evidenced by the Caucasus-related ancestry 
      also detected in Anatolians. In contrast, Middle BA (MBA) individuals of northern 
      Greece differ from EBA populations in showing ∼50% Pontic-Caspian Steppe-related 
      ancestry, dated at ca. 2,600-2,000 BCE. Such gene flow events during the MBA 
      contributed toward shaping present-day Greek genomes.

AB  - When it comes to precision oncology, proteogenomics may provide better prospects to 
      the clinical characterization of tumors, help make a more accurate diagnosis of 
      cancer, and improve treatment for patients with cancer. This perspective describes 
      the significant contributions of The Cancer Genome Atlas and the Clinical Proteomic 
      Tumor Analysis Consortium to precision oncology and makes the case that 
      proteogenomics needs to be fully integrated into clinical trials and patient care in 
      order for precision oncology to deliver the right cancer treatment to the right 
      patient at the right dose and at the right time.

AB  - Hearing involves two fundamental processes: mechano-electrical transduction and 
      signal amplification. Despite decades of studies, the molecular bases for both 
      remain elusive. Here, we show how prestin, the electromotive molecule of outer hair 
      cells (OHCs) that senses both voltage and membrane tension, mediates signal 
      amplification by coupling conformational changes to alterations in membrane surface 
      area. Cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of human prestin bound with 
      chloride or salicylate at a common "anion site" adopt contracted or expanded states, 
      respectively. Prestin is ensconced within a perimeter of well-ordered lipids, 
      through which it induces dramatic deformation in the membrane and couples protein 
      conformational changes to the bulk membrane. Together with computational studies, we 
      illustrate how the anion site is allosterically coupled to changes in the 
      transmembrane domain cross-sectional area and the surrounding membrane. These 
      studies provide insight into OHC electromotility by providing a structure-based 
      mechanism of the membrane motor prestin.

AB  - Our genome at conception determines much of our health as an adult. Most human 
      diseases have a heritable component and thus may be preventable through heritable 
      genome editing. Preventing disease from the beginning of life before irreversible 
      damage has occurred is an admirable goal, but the path to fruition remains unclear. 
      Here, we review the significant scientific contributions to the field of human 
      heritable genome editing, the unique ethical challenges that cannot be overlooked, 
      and the hurdles that must be overcome prior to translating these technologies into 
      clinical practice.

AB  - Vaccination elicits immune responses capable of potently neutralizing SARS-CoV-2. 
      However, ongoing surveillance has revealed the emergence of variants harboring 
      mutations in spike, the main target of neutralizing antibodies. To understand the 
      impact of these variants, we evaluated the neutralization potency of 99 individuals 
      that received one or two doses of either BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines against 
      pseudoviruses representing 10 globally circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2. Five of 
      the 10 pseudoviruses, harboring receptor-binding domain mutations, including 
      K417N/T, E484K, and N501Y, were highly resistant to neutralization. 
      Cross-neutralization of B.1.351 variants was comparable to SARS-CoV and bat-derived 
      WIV1-CoV, suggesting that a relatively small number of mutations can mediate potent 
      escape from vaccine responses. While the clinical impact of neutralization 
      resistance remains uncertain, these results highlight the potential for variants to 
      escape from neutralizing humoral immunity and emphasize the need to develop broadly 
      protective interventions against the evolving pandemic.

AB  - Mouse embryonic development is a canonical model system for studying mammalian cell 
      fate acquisition. Recently, single-cell atlases comprehensively charted embryonic 
      transcriptional landscapes, yet inference of the coordinated dynamics of cells over 
      such atlases remains challenging. Here, we introduce a temporal model for mouse 
      gastrulation, consisting of data from 153 individually sampled embryos spanning 36 h 
      of molecular diversification. Using algorithms and precise timing, we infer 
      differentiation flows and lineage specification dynamics over the embryonic 
      transcriptional manifold. Rapid transcriptional bifurcations characterize the 
      commitment of early specialized node and blood cells. However, for most lineages, we 
      observe combinatorial multi-furcation dynamics rather than hierarchical 
      transcriptional transitions. In the mesoderm, dozens of transcription factors 
      combinatorially regulate multifurcations, as we exemplify using time-matched 
      chimeric embryos of Foxc1/Foxc2 mutants. Our study rejects the notion of 
      differentiation being governed by a series of binary choices, providing an 
      alternative quantitative model for cell fate acquisition.

AB  - Recent reports suggest that some SARS-CoV-2 genetic variants, such as B.1.1.7, might 
      be more transmissible and are quickly spreading around the world. As the emergence 
      of more transmissible variants could exacerbate the pandemic, we provide public 
      health guidance for increased surveillance and measures to reduce community 
      transmission.

AB  - Social homeostasis is the ability of individuals to detect the quantity and quality 
      of social contact, compare it to an established set-point in a command center, and 
      adjust the effort expended to seek the optimal social contact expressed via an 
      effector system. Social contact becomes a positive or negative valence stimulus when 
      it is deficient or in excess, respectively. Chronic deficits lead to set-point 
      adaptations such that reintroduction to the previous optimum is experienced as a 
      surplus. Here, we build upon previous models for social homeostasis to include 
      adaptations to lasting changes in environmental conditions, such as with chronic 
      isolation.

AB  - Spatial barcoding technologies have the potential to reveal histological details of 
      transcriptomic profiles; however, they are currently limited by their low 
      resolution. Here, we report Seq-Scope, a spatial barcoding technology with a 
      resolution comparable to an optical microscope. Seq-Scope is based on a solid-phase 
      amplification of randomly barcoded single-molecule oligonucleotides using an 
      Illumina sequencing platform. The resulting clusters annotated with spatial 
      coordinates are processed to expose RNA-capture moiety. These RNA-capturing barcoded 
      clusters define the pixels of Seq-Scope that are ∼0.5-0.8 μm apart from each other. 
      From tissue sections, Seq-Scope visualizes spatial transcriptome heterogeneity at 
      multiple histological scales, including tissue zonation according to the 
      portal-central (liver), crypt-surface (colon) and inflammation-fibrosis (injured 
      liver) axes, cellular components including single-cell types and subtypes, and 
      subcellular architectures of nucleus and cytoplasm. Seq-Scope is quick, 
      straightforward, precise, and easy-to-implement and makes spatial single-cell 
      analysis accessible to a wide group of biomedical researchers.

      infection.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is 
      continuing to disrupt personal lives, global healthcare systems, and economies. 
      Hence, there is an urgent need for a vaccine that prevents viral infection, 
      transmission, and disease. Here, we present a two-component protein-based 
      nanoparticle vaccine that displays multiple copies of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. 
      Immunization studies show that this vaccine induces potent neutralizing antibody 
      responses in mice, rabbits, and cynomolgus macaques. The vaccine-induced immunity 
      protects macaques against a high-dose challenge, resulting in strongly reduced viral 
      infection and replication in the upper and lower airways. These nanoparticles are a 
      promising vaccine candidate to curtail the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.

AB  - Human monoclonal antibodies are safe, preventive, and therapeutic tools that can be 
      rapidly developed to help restore the massive health and economic disruption caused 
      by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. By single-cell sorting 4,277 
      SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific memory B cells from 14 COVID-19 survivors, 453 
      neutralizing antibodies were identified. The most potent neutralizing antibodies 
      recognized the spike protein receptor-binding domain, followed in potency by 
      antibodies that recognize the S1 domain, the spike protein trimer, and the S2 
      subunit. Only 1.4% of them neutralized the authentic virus with a potency of 
      1-10 ng/mL. The most potent monoclonal antibody, engineered to reduce the risk of 
      antibody-dependent enhancement and prolong half-life, neutralized the authentic 
      wild-type virus and emerging variants containing D614G, E484K, and N501Y 
      substitutions. Prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in the hamster model was 
      observed at 0.25 and 4 mg/kg respectively in absence of Fc functions.

AB  - Dopamine receptors, including D1- and D2-like receptors, are important therapeutic 
      targets in a variety of neurological syndromes, as well as cardiovascular and kidney 
      diseases. Here, we present five cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the 
      dopamine D1 receptor (DRD1) coupled to Gs heterotrimer in complex with three 
      catechol-based agonists, a non-catechol agonist, and a positive allosteric modulator 
      for endogenous dopamine. These structures revealed that a polar interaction network 
      is essential for catecholamine-like agonist recognition, whereas specific motifs in 
      the extended binding pocket were responsible for discriminating D1- from D2-like 
      receptors. Moreover, allosteric binding at a distinct inner surface pocket improved 
      the activity of DRD1 by stabilizing endogenous dopamine interaction at the 
      orthosteric site. DRD1-Gs interface revealed key features that serve as determinants 
      for G protein coupling. Together, our study provides a structural understanding of 
      the ligand recognition, allosteric regulation, and G protein coupling mechanisms of 
      DRD1.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 is the cause of a pandemic with growing global mortality. Using 
      comprehensive identification of RNA-binding proteins by mass spectrometry 
      (ChIRP-MS), we identified 309 host proteins that bind the SARS-CoV-2 RNA during 
      active infection. Integration of this data with ChIRP-MS data from three other RNA 
      viruses defined viral specificity of RNA-host protein interactions. Targeted CRISPR 
      screens revealed that the majority of functional RNA-binding proteins protect the 
      host from virus-induced cell death, and comparative CRISPR screens across seven RNA 
      viruses revealed shared and SARS-specific antiviral factors. Finally, by combining 
      the RNA-centric approach and functional CRISPR screens, we demonstrated a physical 
      and functional connection between SARS-CoV-2 and mitochondria, highlighting this 
      organelle as a general platform for antiviral activity. Altogether, these data 
      provide a comprehensive catalog of functional SARS-CoV-2 RNA-host protein 
      interactions, which may inform studies to understand the host-virus interface and 
      nominate host pathways that could be targeted for therapeutic benefit.

AB  - In this issue of Cell, Spellman and colleagues record and manipulate the activity of 
      neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex of mice performing a task in which they must 
      pay attention to different stimuli. They show that this brain region is important 
      for monitoring the animals' performance, and neurons that appear to contribute to 
      behavior reside in deep cortical layers.

AB  - Potato breeding efforts have long been hindered by the genetic consequences of 
      millennia of clonal propagation. To mitigate genomic constraints, Zhang et al. 
      leverage an unprecedented scale of sequencing and marker-assisted breeding to unlock 
      traits that have not been possible through classical breeding, providing a blueprint 
      for plant genome design.

AB  - Immune evasion and resistance to immunotherapy mark major roadblocks in treating 
      glioblastoma, the deadliest form of brain cancer. In this issue of Cell, Gangoso 
      et al. demonstrate that the immune microenvironment drives glioblastoma cells to 
      hijack myeloid-characteristic transcriptional and epigenetic circuits as a mode of 
      immune evasion.

TI  - Osteoclasts recycle via osteomorphs during RANKL-stimulated bone resorption.
PG  - 1330-1347.e13
LID - S0092-8674(21)00152-5 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.cell.2021.02.002 [doi]
AB  - Osteoclasts are large multinucleated bone-resorbing cells formed by the fusion of 
      monocyte/macrophage-derived precursors that are thought to undergo apoptosis once 
      resorption is complete. Here, by intravital imaging, we reveal that RANKL-stimulated 
      osteoclasts have an alternative cell fate in which they fission into daughter cells 
      called osteomorphs. Inhibiting RANKL blocked this cellular recycling and resulted in 
      osteomorph accumulation. Single-cell RNA sequencing showed that osteomorphs are 
      transcriptionally distinct from osteoclasts and macrophages and express a number of 
      non-canonical osteoclast genes that are associated with structural and functional 
      bone phenotypes when deleted in mice. Furthermore, genetic variation in human 
      orthologs of osteomorph genes causes monogenic skeletal disorders and associates 
      with bone mineral density, a polygenetic skeletal trait. Thus, osteoclasts recycle 
      via osteomorphs, a cell type involved in the regulation of bone resorption that may 
      be targeted for the treatment of skeletal diseases.

AB  - In this issue of Cell, Evavold et al. (2021) report that mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1), a 
      metabolic signaling complex, controls reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in 
      mitochondria, which in turn promotes inflammatory cell death mediated by gasdermin D 
      (GSDMD). This provides a new mechanistic connection between metabolic signaling and 
      inflammatory cell death.

AB  - Cancer cell genetic variability and similarity to host cells have stymied 
      development of broad anti-cancer therapeutics. Our innate immune system evolved to 
      clear genetically diverse pathogens and limit host toxicity; however, whether/how 
      innate immunity can produce similar effects in cancer is unknown. Here, we show that 
      human, but not murine, neutrophils release catalytically active neutrophil elastase 
      (ELANE) to kill many cancer cell types while sparing non-cancer cells. ELANE 
      proteolytically liberates the CD95 death domain, which interacts with histone H1 
      isoforms to selectively eradicate cancer cells. ELANE attenuates primary tumor 
      growth and produces a CD8(+)T cell-mediated abscopal effect to attack distant 
      metastases. Porcine pancreatic elastase (ELANE homolog) resists tumor-derived 
      protease inhibitors and exhibits markedly improved therapeutic efficacy. Altogether, 
      our studies suggest that ELANE kills genetically diverse cancer cells with minimal 
      toxicity to non-cancer cells, raising the possibility of developing it as a broad 
      anti-cancer therapy.

AB  - Complex datasets provide opportunities for discoveries beyond their initial scope. 
      Effective and rapid data sharing and management practices are crucial to realize 
      this potential; however, they are harder to implement than post-publication access. 
      Here, we introduce the concept of a "data sharing trust" to maximize the value of 
      large datasets.

AB  - Precision oncology has made significant advances, mainly by targeting actionable 
      mutations in cancer driver genes. Aiming to expand treatment opportunities, recent 
      studies have begun to explore the utility of tumor transcriptome to guide patient 
      treatment. Here, we introduce SELECT (synthetic lethality and rescue-mediated 
      precision oncology via the transcriptome), a precision oncology framework harnessing 
      genetic interactions to predict patient response to cancer therapy from the tumor 
      transcriptome. SELECT is tested on a broad collection of 35 published targeted and 
      immunotherapy clinical trials from 10 different cancer types. It is predictive of 
      patients' response in 80% of these clinical trials and in the recent multi-arm 
      WINTHER trial. The predictive signatures and the code are made publicly available 
      for academic use, laying a basis for future prospective clinical studies.

AB  - The prevalence of type 2 diabetes and obesity has risen dramatically for decades and 
      is expected to rise further, secondary to the growing aging, sedentary population. 
      The strain on global health care is projected to be colossal. This review explores 
      the latest work and emerging ideas related to genetic and environmental factors 
      influencing metabolism. Translational research and clinical applications, including 
      the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, are highlighted. Looking forward, strategies to 
      personalize all aspects of prevention, management and care are necessary to improve 
      health outcomes and reduce the impact of these metabolic diseases.

AB  - Gasdermin B (GSDMB) belongs to a large family of pore-forming cytolysins that 
      execute inflammatory cell death programs. While genetic studies have linked GSDMB 
      polymorphisms to human disease, its function in the immunological response to 
      pathogens remains poorly understood. Here, we report a dynamic host-pathogen 
      conflict between GSDMB and the IpaH7.8 effector protein secreted by enteroinvasive 
      Shigella flexneri. We show that IpaH7.8 ubiquitinates and targets GSDMB for 26S 
      proteasome destruction. This virulence strategy protects Shigella from the 
      bacteriocidic activity of natural killer cells by suppressing granzyme-A-mediated 
      activation of GSDMB. In contrast to the canonical function of most gasdermin family 
      members, GSDMB does not inhibit Shigella by lysing host cells. Rather, it exhibits 
      direct microbiocidal activity through recognition of phospholipids found on 
      Gram-negative bacterial membranes. These findings place GSDMB as a central 
      executioner of intracellular bacterial killing and reveal a mechanism employed by 
      pathogens to counteract this host defense system.

AB  - Defects in translation lead to changes in the expression of proteins that can serve 
      as drivers of cancer formation. Here, we show that cytosolic NAD(+) synthesis plays 
      an essential role in ovarian cancer by regulating translation and maintaining 
      protein homeostasis. Expression of NMNAT-2, a cytosolic NAD(+) synthase, is highly 
      upregulated in ovarian cancers. NMNAT-2 supports the catalytic activity of the 
      mono(ADP-ribosyl) transferase (MART) PARP-16, which mono(ADP-ribosyl)ates 
      (MARylates) ribosomal proteins. Depletion of NMNAT-2 or PARP-16 leads to inhibition 
      of MARylation, increased polysome association and enhanced translation of specific 
      mRNAs, aggregation of their translated protein products, and reduced growth of 
      ovarian cancer cells. Furthermore, MARylation of the ribosomal proteins, such as 
      RPL24 and RPS6, inhibits polysome assembly by stabilizing eIF6 binding to ribosomes. 
      Collectively, our results demonstrate that ribosome MARylation promotes protein 
      homeostasis in cancers by fine-tuning the levels of protein synthesis and preventing 
      toxic protein aggregation.

AB  - Most human embryos are aneuploid. Aneuploidy frequently arises during the early 
      mitotic divisions of the embryo, but its origin remains elusive. Human zygotes that 
      cluster their nucleoli at the pronuclear interface are thought to be more likely to 
      develop into healthy euploid embryos. Here, we show that the parental genomes 
      cluster with nucleoli in each pronucleus within human and bovine zygotes, and 
      clustering is required for the reliable unification of the parental genomes after 
      fertilization. During migration of intact pronuclei, the parental genomes polarize 
      toward each other in a process driven by centrosomes, dynein, microtubules, and 
      nuclear pore complexes. The maternal and paternal chromosomes eventually cluster at 
      the pronuclear interface, in direct proximity to each other, yet separated. Parental 
      genome clustering ensures the rapid unification of the parental genomes on nuclear 
      envelope breakdown. However, clustering often fails, leading to chromosome 
      segregation errors and micronuclei, incompatible with healthy embryo development.

      membrane curvature. Using cryo-EM, we visualized how PspA remodels membrane vesicles 
      into μm-sized structures and how it mediates the formation of internalized vesicular 
      structures. Hotspots of these activities are zones derived from PspA assemblies, 
      serving as lipid transfer platforms and linking previously separated lipid 
      structures. These membrane fusion and fission activities are in line with the 
      described functional properties of bacterial PspA/IM30/LiaH proteins. Our structural 
      and functional analyses reveal that bacterial PspA belongs to the evolutionary 
      ancestry of ESCRT-III proteins involved in membrane remodeling.

AB  - Searching for factors to improve knockin efficiency for therapeutic applications, 
      biotechnology, and generation of non-human primate models of disease, we found that 
      the strand exchange protein RAD51 can significantly increase Cas9-mediated 
      homozygous knockin in mouse embryos through an interhomolog repair (IHR) mechanism. 
      IHR is a hallmark of meiosis but only occurs at low frequencies in somatic cells, 
      and its occurrence in zygotes is controversial. Using multiple approaches, we 
      provide evidence for an endogenous IHR mechanism in the early embryo that can be 
      enhanced by RAD51. This process can be harnessed to generate homozygotes from 
      wild-type zygotes using exogenous donors and to convert heterozygous alleles into 
      homozygous alleles without exogenous templates. Furthermore, we identify additional 
      IHR-promoting factors and describe features of IHR events. Together, our findings 
      show conclusive evidence for IHR in mouse embryos and describe an efficient method 
      for enhanced gene conversion.

AB  - Mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are commonly implicated in the 
      pathogenesis of both familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD). LRRK2 regulates 
      critical cellular processes at membranous organelles and forms microtubule-based 
      pathogenic filaments, yet the molecular basis underlying these biological roles of 
      LRRK2 remains largely enigmatic. Here, we determined high-resolution structures of 
      full-length human LRRK2, revealing its architecture and key interdomain scaffolding 
      elements for rationalizing disease-causing mutations. The kinase domain of LRRK2 is 
      captured in an inactive state, a conformation also adopted by the most common 
      PD-associated mutation, LRRK2(G2019S). This conformation serves as a framework for 
      structure-guided design of conformational specific inhibitors. We further determined 
      the structure of COR-mediated LRRK2 dimers and found that single-point mutations at 
      the dimer interface abolished pathogenic filamentation in cells. Overall, our study 
      provides mechanistic insights into physiological and pathological roles of LRRK2 and 
      establishes a structural template for future therapeutic intervention in PD.

AB  - Understanding population health disparities is an essential component of equitable 
      precision health efforts. Epidemiology research often relies on definitions of race 
      and ethnicity, but these population labels may not adequately capture disease 
      burdens and environmental factors impacting specific sub-populations. Here, we 
      propose a framework for repurposing data from electronic health records (EHRs) in 
      concert with genomic data to explore the demographic ties that can impact disease 
      burdens. Using data from a diverse biobank in New York City, we identified 17 
      communities sharing recent genetic ancestry. We observed 1,177 health outcomes that 
      were statistically associated with a specific group and demonstrated significant 
      differences in the segregation of genetic variants contributing to Mendelian 
      diseases. We also demonstrated that fine-scale population structure can impact the 
      prediction of complex disease risk within groups. This work reinforces the utility 
      of linking genomic data to EHRs and provides a framework toward fine-scale 
      monitoring of population health.

AB  - Neural activity underlying short-term memory is maintained by interconnected 
      networks of brain regions. It remains unknown how brain regions interact to maintain 
      persistent activity while exhibiting robustness to corrupt information in parts of 
      the network. We simultaneously measured activity in large neuronal populations 
      across mouse frontal hemispheres to probe interactions between brain regions. 
      Activity across hemispheres was coordinated to maintain coherent short-term memory. 
      Across mice, we uncovered individual variability in the organization of frontal 
      cortical networks. A modular organization was required for the robustness of 
      persistent activity to perturbations: each hemisphere retained persistent activity 
      during perturbations of the other hemisphere, thus preventing local perturbations 
      from spreading. A dynamic gating mechanism allowed hemispheres to coordinate 
      coherent information while gating out corrupt information. Our results show that 
      robust short-term memory is mediated by redundant modular representations across 
      brain regions. Redundant modular representations naturally emerge in neural network 
      models that learned robust dynamics.

AB  - The human brain has undergone rapid expansion since humans diverged from other great 
      apes, but the mechanism of this human-specific enlargement is still unknown. Here, 
      we use cerebral organoids derived from human, gorilla, and chimpanzee cells to study 
      developmental mechanisms driving evolutionary brain expansion. We find that 
      neuroepithelial differentiation is a protracted process in apes, involving a 
      previously unrecognized transition state characterized by a change in cell shape. 
      Furthermore, we show that human organoids are larger due to a delay in this 
      transition, associated with differences in interkinetic nuclear migration and cell 
      cycle length. Comparative RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) reveals differences in expression 
      dynamics of cell morphogenesis factors, including ZEB2, a known 
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition regulator. We show that ZEB2 promotes 
      neuroepithelial transition, and its manipulation and downstream signaling leads to 
      acquisition of nonhuman ape architecture in the human context and vice versa, 
      establishing an important role for neuroepithelial cell shape in human brain 
      expansion.

AB  - Immune-microbe interactions early in life influence the risk of allergies, asthma, 
      and other inflammatory diseases. Breastfeeding guides healthier immune-microbe 
      relationships by providing nutrients to specialized microbes that in turn benefit 
      the host's immune system. Such bacteria have co-evolved with humans but are now 
      increasingly rare in modern societies. Here we show that a lack of bifidobacteria, 
      and in particular depletion of genes required for human milk oligosaccharide (HMO) 
      utilization from the metagenome, is associated with systemic inflammation and immune 
      dysregulation early in life. In breastfed infants given Bifidobacterium infantis 
      EVC001, which expresses all HMO-utilization genes, intestinal T helper 2 (Th2) and 
      Th17 cytokines were silenced and interferon β (IFNβ) was induced. Fecal water from 
      EVC001-supplemented infants contains abundant indolelactate and B. infantis-derived 
      indole-3-lactic acid (ILA) upregulated immunoregulatory galectin-1 in Th2 and Th17 
      cells during polarization, providing a functional link between beneficial microbes 
      and immunoregulation during the first months of life.

AB  - We present evidence for multiple independent origins of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 
      viruses sampled from late 2020 and early 2021 in the United Kingdom. Their genomes 
      carry single-nucleotide polymorphisms and deletions that are characteristic of the 
      B.1.1.7 variant of concern but lack the full complement of lineage-defining 
      mutations. Instead, the remainder of their genomes share contiguous genetic 
      variation with non-B.1.1.7 viruses circulating in the same geographic area at the 
      same time as the recombinants. In four instances, there was evidence for onward 
      transmission of a recombinant-origin virus, including one transmission cluster of 45 
      sequenced cases over the course of 2 months. The inferred genomic locations of 
      recombination breakpoints suggest that every community-transmitted recombinant virus 
      inherited its spike region from a B.1.1.7 parental virus, consistent with a 
      transmission advantage for B.1.1.7's set of mutations.

AB  - In motor neuroscience, state changes are hypothesized to time-lock neural assemblies 
      coordinating complex movements, but evidence for this remains slender. We tested 
      whether a discrete change from more autonomous to coherent spiking underlies skilled 
      movement by imaging cerebellar Purkinje neuron complex spikes in mice making 
      targeted forelimb-reaches. As mice learned the task, millimeter-scale 
      spatiotemporally coherent spiking emerged ipsilateral to the reaching forelimb, and 
      consistent neural synchronization became predictive of kinematic stereotypy. Before 
      reach onset, spiking switched from more disordered to internally time-locked 
      concerted spiking and silence. Optogenetic manipulations of cerebellar feedback to 
      the inferior olive bi-directionally modulated neural synchronization and reaching 
      direction. A simple model explained the reorganization of spiking during reaching as 
      reflecting a discrete bifurcation in olivary network dynamics. These findings argue 
      that to prepare learned movements, olivo-cerebellar circuits enter a self-regulated, 
      synchronized state promoting motor coordination. State changes facilitating 
      behavioral transitions may generalize across neural systems.

AB  - Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-mediated activation of downstream effector pathways 
      such as the RAS GTPase/MAP kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade is thought to occur 
      exclusively from lipid membrane compartments in mammalian cells. Here, we uncover a 
      membraneless, protein granule-based subcellular structure that can organize 
      RTK/RAS/MAPK signaling in cancer. Chimeric (fusion) oncoproteins involving certain 
      RTKs including ALK and RET undergo de novo higher-order assembly into membraneless 
      cytoplasmic protein granules that actively signal. These pathogenic biomolecular 
      condensates locally concentrate the RAS activating complex GRB2/SOS1 and activate 
      RAS in a lipid membrane-independent manner. RTK protein granule formation is 
      critical for oncogenic RAS/MAPK signaling output in these cells. We identify a set 
      of protein granule components and establish structural rules that define the 
      formation of membraneless protein granules by RTK oncoproteins. Our findings reveal 
      membraneless, higher-order cytoplasmic protein assembly as a distinct subcellular 
      platform for organizing oncogenic RTK and RAS signaling.

AB  - An ability to build structured mental maps of the world underpins our capacity to 
      imagine relationships between objects that extend beyond experience. In rodents, 
      such representations are supported by sequential place cell reactivations during 
      rest, known as replay. Schizophrenia is proposed to reflect a compromise in 
      structured mental representations, with animal models reporting abnormalities in 
      hippocampal replay and associated ripple activity during rest. Here, utilizing 
      magnetoencephalography (MEG), we tasked patients with schizophrenia and control 
      participants to infer unobserved relationships between objects by reorganizing 
      visual experiences containing these objects. During a post-task rest session, 
      controls exhibited fast spontaneous neural reactivation of presented objects that 
      replayed inferred relationships. Replay was coincident with increased ripple power 
      in hippocampus. Patients showed both reduced replay and augmented ripple power 
      relative to controls, convergent with findings in animal models. These abnormalities 
      are linked to impairments in behavioral acquisition and subsequent neural 
      representation of task structure.

AB  - Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) remains a major health threat. Viral capsid 
      uncoating and nuclear import of the viral genome are critical for productive 
      infection. The size of the HIV-1 capsid is generally believed to exceed the diameter 
      of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), indicating that capsid uncoating has to occur 
      prior to nuclear import. Here, we combined correlative light and electron microscopy 
      with subtomogram averaging to capture the structural status of reverse 
      transcription-competent HIV-1 complexes in infected T cells. We demonstrated that 
      the diameter of the NPC in cellulo is sufficient for the import of apparently 
      intact, cone-shaped capsids. Subsequent to nuclear import, we detected disrupted and 
      empty capsid fragments, indicating that uncoating of the replication complex occurs 
      by breaking the capsid open, and not by disassembly into individual subunits. Our 
      data directly visualize a key step in HIV-1 replication and enhance our mechanistic 
      understanding of the viral life cycle.

AB  - Mutations causing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) often affect the condensation 
      properties of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). However, the role of RBP condensation in 
      the specificity and function of protein-RNA complexes remains unclear. We created a 
      series of TDP-43 C-terminal domain (CTD) variants that exhibited a gradient of low 
      to high condensation propensity, as observed in vitro and by nuclear mobility and 
      foci formation. Notably, a capacity for condensation was required for efficient 
      TDP-43 assembly on subsets of RNA-binding regions, which contain unusually long 
      clusters of motifs of characteristic types and density. These "binding-region 
      condensates" are promoted by homomeric CTD-driven interactions and required for 
      efficient regulation of a subset of bound transcripts, including autoregulation of 
      TDP-43 mRNA. We establish that RBP condensation can occur in a 
      binding-region-specific manner to selectively modulate transcriptome-wide RNA 
      regulation, which has implications for remodeling RNA networks in the context of 
      signaling, disease, and evolution.

AB  - Knowing where we are, where we have been, and where we are going is critical to many 
      behaviors, including navigation and memory. One potential neuronal mechanism 
      underlying this ability is phase precession, in which spatially tuned neurons 
      represent sequences of positions by activating at progressively earlier phases of 
      local network theta oscillations. Based on studies in rodents, researchers have 
      hypothesized that phase precession may be a general neural pattern for representing 
      sequential events for learning and memory. By recording human single-neuron activity 
      during spatial navigation, we show that spatially tuned neurons in the human 
      hippocampus and entorhinal cortex exhibit phase precession. Furthermore, beyond the 
      neural representation of locations, we show evidence for phase precession related to 
      specific goal states. Our findings thus extend theta phase precession to humans and 
      suggest that this phenomenon has a broad functional role for the neural 
      representation of both spatial and non-spatial information.

AB  - The organization of genomic DNA into defined nucleosomes has long been viewed as a 
      hallmark of eukaryotes. This paradigm has been challenged by the identification of 
      "minimalist" histones in archaea and more recently by the discovery of genes that 
      encode fused remote homologs of the four eukaryotic histones in Marseilleviridae, a 
      subfamily of giant viruses that infect amoebae. We demonstrate that viral doublet 
      histones are essential for viral infectivity, localize to cytoplasmic viral 
      factories after virus infection, and ultimately are found in the mature virions. 
      Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of viral nucleosome-like 
      particles show strong similarities to eukaryotic nucleosomes despite the limited 
      sequence identify. The unique connectors that link the histone chains contribute to 
      the observed instability of viral nucleosomes, and some histone tails assume 
      structural roles. Our results further expand the range of "organisms" that require 
      nucleosomes and suggest a specialized function of histones in the biology of these 
      unusual viruses.

AB  - Since establishment of the first embryonic stem cells (ESCs), in vitro culture of 
      totipotent cells functionally and molecularly comparable with in vivo blastomeres 
      with embryonic and extraembryonic developmental potential has been a challenge. Here 
      we report that spliceosomal repression in mouse ESCs drives a 
      pluripotent-to-totipotent state transition. Using the splicing inhibitor 
      pladienolide B, we achieve stable in vitro culture of totipotent ESCs comparable at 
      molecular levels with 2- and 4-cell blastomeres, which we call totipotent 
      blastomere-like cells (TBLCs). Mouse chimeric assays combined with single-cell RNA 
      sequencing (scRNA-seq) demonstrate that TBLCs have a robust bidirectional 
      developmental capability to generate multiple embryonic and extraembryonic cell 
      lineages. Mechanically, spliceosomal repression causes widespread splicing 
      inhibition of pluripotent genes, whereas totipotent genes, which contain few short 
      introns, are efficiently spliced and transcriptionally activated. Our study provides 
      a means for capturing and maintaining totipotent stem cells.

AB  - Microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, have emerged as crucial 
      regulators of synaptic refinement and brain wiring. However, whether the remodeling 
      of distinct synapse types during development is mediated by specialized microglia is 
      unknown. Here, we show that GABA-receptive microglia selectively interact with 
      inhibitory cortical synapses during a critical window of mouse postnatal 
      development. GABA initiates a transcriptional synapse remodeling program within 
      these specialized microglia, which in turn sculpt inhibitory connectivity without 
      impacting excitatory synapses. Ablation of GABA(B) receptors within microglia 
      impairs this process and leads to behavioral abnormalities. These findings 
      demonstrate that brain wiring relies on the selective communication between matched 
      neuronal and glial cell types.

AB  - We previously reported that a single immunization with an adenovirus serotype 26 
      (Ad26)-vector-based vaccine expressing an optimized SARS-CoV-2 spike (Ad26.COV2.S) 
      protected rhesus macaques against SARS-CoV-2 challenge. To evaluate reduced doses of 
      Ad26.COV2.S, 30 rhesus macaques were immunized once with 1 × 10(11), 5 × 10(10), 
      1.125 × 10(10), or 2 × 10(9) viral particles (vp) Ad26.COV2.S or sham and were 
      challenged with SARS-CoV-2. Vaccine doses as low as 2 × 10(9) vp provided robust 
      protection in bronchoalveolar lavage, whereas doses of 1.125 × 10(10) vp were 
      required for protection in nasal swabs. Activated memory B cells and binding or 
      neutralizing antibody titers following vaccination correlated with protective 
      efficacy. At suboptimal vaccine doses, viral breakthrough was observed but did not 
      show enhancement of disease. These data demonstrate that a single immunization with 
      relatively low dose of Ad26.COV2.S effectively protected against SARS-CoV-2 
      challenge in rhesus macaques, although a higher vaccine dose may be required for 
      protection in the upper respiratory tract.

AB  - Electrical stimulation is a promising tool for modulating brain networks. However, 
      it is unclear how stimulation interacts with neural patterns underlying behavior. 
      Specifically, how might external stimulation that is not sensitive to the state of 
      ongoing neural dynamics reliably augment neural processing and improve function? 
      Here, we tested how low-frequency epidural alternating current stimulation (ACS) in 
      non-human primates recovering from stroke interacted with task-related activity in 
      perilesional cortex and affected grasping. We found that ACS increased co-firing 
      within task-related ensembles and improved dexterity. Using a neural network model, 
      we found that simulated ACS drove ensemble co-firing and enhanced propagation of 
      neural activity through parts of the network with impaired connectivity, suggesting 
      a mechanism to link increased co-firing to enhanced dexterity. Together, our results 
      demonstrate that ACS restores neural processing in impaired networks and improves 
      dexterity following stroke. More broadly, these results demonstrate approaches to 
      optimize stimulation to target neural dynamics.

AB  - The global spread of SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 is devastating health systems and economies 
      worldwide. Recombinant or vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies are used to combat 
      the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 
      (UK), B.1.351 (South Africa), and P.1 (Brazil) harbor mutations in the viral spike 
      (S) protein that may alter virus-host cell interactions and confer resistance to 
      inhibitors and antibodies. Here, using pseudoparticles, we show that entry of all 
      variants into human cells is susceptible to blockade by the entry inhibitors soluble 
      ACE2, Camostat, EK-1, and EK-1-C4. In contrast, entry of the B.1.351 and P.1 variant 
      was partially (Casirivimab) or fully (Bamlanivimab) resistant to antibodies used for 
      COVID-19 treatment. Moreover, entry of these variants was less efficiently inhibited 
      by plasma from convalescent COVID-19 patients and sera from BNT162b2-vaccinated 
      individuals. These results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may escape neutralizing antibody 
      responses, which has important implications for efforts to contain the pandemic.

AB  - Cultivated rice varieties are all diploid, and polyploidization of rice has long 
      been desired because of its advantages in genome buffering, vigorousness, and 
      environmental robustness. However, a workable route remains elusive. Here, we 
      describe a practical strategy, namely de novo domestication of wild allotetraploid 
      rice. By screening allotetraploid wild rice inventory, we identified one genotype of 
      Oryza alta (CCDD), polyploid rice 1 (PPR1), and established two important resources 
      for its de novo domestication: (1) an efficient tissue culture, transformation, and 
      genome editing system and (2) a high-quality genome assembly discriminated into two 
      subgenomes of 12 chromosomes apiece. With these resources, we show that six 
      agronomically important traits could be rapidly improved by editing O. alta homologs 
      of the genes controlling these traits in diploid rice. Our results demonstrate the 
      possibility that de novo domesticated allotetraploid rice can be developed into a 
      new staple cereal to strengthen world food security.

AB  - Memory B cell reserves can generate protective antibodies against repeated 
      SARS-CoV-2 infections, but with unknown reach from original infection to 
      antigenically drifted variants. We charted memory B cell receptor-encoded antibodies 
      from 19 COVID-19 convalescent subjects against SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) and found seven 
      major antibody competition groups against epitopes recurrently targeted across 
      individuals. Inclusion of published and newly determined structures of antibody-S 
      complexes identified corresponding epitopic regions. Group assignment correlated 
      with cross-CoV-reactivity breadth, neutralization potency, and convergent antibody 
      signatures. Although emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern escaped binding by many 
      members of the groups associated with the most potent neutralizing activity, some 
      antibodies in each of those groups retained affinity-suggesting that otherwise 
      redundant components of a primary immune response are important for durable 
      protection from evolving pathogens. Our results furnish a global atlas of S-specific 
      memory B cell repertoires and illustrate properties driving viral escape and 
      conferring robustness against emerging variants.

AB  - Many transient receptor potential (TRP) channels respond to diverse stimuli and 
      conditionally conduct small and large cations. Such functional plasticity is 
      presumably enabled by a uniquely dynamic ion selectivity filter that is regulated by 
      physiological agents. What is currently missing is a "photo series" of intermediate 
      structural states that directly address this hypothesis and reveal specific 
      mechanisms behind such dynamic channel regulation. Here, we exploit cryoelectron 
      microscopy (cryo-EM) to visualize conformational transitions of the capsaicin 
      receptor, TRPV1, as a model to understand how dynamic transitions of the selectivity 
      filter in response to algogenic agents, including protons, vanilloid agonists, and 
      peptide toxins, permit permeation by small and large organic cations. These 
      structures also reveal mechanisms governing ligand binding substates, as well as 
      allosteric coupling between key sites that are proximal to the selectivity filter 
      and cytoplasmic gate. These insights suggest a general framework for understanding 
      how TRP channels function as polymodal signal integrators.

AB  - Biomolecules are in constant motion. To understand how they function, and why 
      malfunctions can cause disease, it is necessary to describe their three-dimensional 
      structures in terms of dynamic conformational ensembles. Here, we demonstrate how 
      nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy provides an essential, dynamic view of 
      structural biology that captures biomolecular motions at atomic resolution. We focus 
      on examples that emphasize the diversity of biomolecules and biochemical 
      applications that are amenable to NMR, such as elucidating functional dynamics in 
      large molecular machines, characterizing transient conformations implicated in the 
      onset of disease, and obtaining atomic-level descriptions of intrinsically 
      disordered regions that make weak interactions involved in liquid-liquid phase 
      separation. Finally, we discuss the pivotal role that NMR has played in driving 
      forward our understanding of the biomolecular dynamics-function paradigm.

AB  - A general approach for heritably altering gene expression has the potential to 
      enable many discovery and therapeutic efforts. Here, we present CRISPRoff-a 
      programmable epigenetic memory writer consisting of a single dead Cas9 fusion 
      protein that establishes DNA methylation and repressive histone modifications. 
      Transient CRISPRoff expression initiates highly specific DNA methylation and gene 
      repression that is maintained through cell division and differentiation of stem 
      cells to neurons. Pairing CRISPRoff with genome-wide screens and analysis of 
      chromatin marks establishes rules for heritable gene silencing. We identify single 
      guide RNAs (sgRNAs) capable of silencing the large majority of genes including those 
      lacking canonical CpG islands (CGIs) and reveal a wide targeting window extending 
      beyond annotated CGIs. The broad ability of CRISPRoff to initiate heritable gene 
      silencing even outside of CGIs expands the canonical model of methylation-based 
      silencing and enables diverse applications including genome-wide screens, 
      multiplexed cell engineering, enhancer silencing, and mechanistic exploration of 
      epigenetic inheritance.

AB  - Lungfishes are the closest extant relatives of tetrapods and preserve ancestral 
      traits linked with the water-to-land transition. However, their huge genome sizes 
      have hindered understanding of this key transition in evolution. Here, we report a 
      40-Gb chromosome-level assembly of the African lungfish (Protopterus annectens) 
      genome, which is the largest genome assembly ever reported and has a contig and 
      chromosome N50 of 1.60 Mb and 2.81 Gb, respectively. The large size of the lungfish 
      genome is due mainly to retrotransposons. Genes with ultra-long length show similar 
      expression levels to other genes, indicating that lungfishes have evolved high 
      transcription efficacy to keep gene expression balanced. Together with transcriptome 
      and experimental data, we identified potential genes and regulatory elements related 
      to such terrestrial adaptation traits as pulmonary surfactant, anxiolytic ability, 
      pentadactyl limbs, and pharyngeal remodeling. Our results provide insights and key 
      resources for understanding the evolutionary pathway leading from fishes to humans.

AB  - The highly transmissible B.1.1.7 variant of SARS-CoV-2, first identified in the 
      United Kingdom, has gained a foothold across the world. Using S gene target failure 
      (SGTF) and SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequencing, we investigated the prevalence and 
      dynamics of this variant in the United States (US), tracking it back to its early 
      emergence. We found that, while the fraction of B.1.1.7 varied by state, the variant 
      increased at a logistic rate with a roughly weekly doubling rate and an increased 
      transmission of 40%-50%. We revealed several independent introductions of B.1.1.7 
      into the US as early as late November 2020, with community transmission spreading it 
      to most states within months. We show that the US is on a similar trajectory as 
      other countries where B.1.1.7 became dominant, requiring immediate and decisive 
      action to minimize COVID-19 morbidity and mortality.

AB  - The α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor plays critical roles in the central nervous 
      system and in the cholinergic inflammatory pathway. This ligand-gated ion channel 
      assembles as a homopentamer, is exceptionally permeable to Ca(2+), and desensitizes 
      faster than any other Cys-loop receptor. The α7 receptor has served as a prototype 
      for the Cys-loop superfamily yet has proven refractory to structural analysis. We 
      present cryo-EM structures of the human α7 nicotinic receptor in a lipidic 
      environment in resting, activated, and desensitized states, illuminating the 
      principal steps in the gating cycle. The structures also reveal elements that 
      contribute to its function, including a C-terminal latch that is permissive for 
      channel opening, and an anionic ring in the extracellular vestibule that contributes 
      to its high conductance and calcium permeability. Comparisons among the α7 
      structures provide a foundation for mapping the gating cycle and reveal divergence 
      in gating mechanisms in the Cys-loop receptor superfamily.

AB  - Meiotic recombination drives the formation of new chromosomes in germ cells and is 
      essential for fertility in mammals. In this issue of Cell, Pratto et al. have 
      developed a method to map replication origins directly in mammalian tissue for the 
      first time, revealing evolutionary conservation between replication timing and 
      meiotic recombination in males.

AB  - Iron overload causes progressive organ damage and is associated with arthritis, 
      liver damage, and heart failure. Elevated iron levels are present in 1%-5% of 
      individuals; however, iron overload is undermonitored and underdiagnosed. Genetic 
      factors affecting iron homeostasis are emerging. Individuals with hereditary 
      xerocytosis, a rare disorder with gain-of-function (GOF) mutations in 
      mechanosensitive PIEZO1 ion channel, develop age-onset iron overload. We show that 
      constitutive or macrophage expression of a GOF Piezo1 allele in mice disrupts levels 
      of the iron regulator hepcidin and causes iron overload. We further show that PIEZO1 
      is a key regulator of macrophage phagocytic activity and subsequent erythrocyte 
      turnover. Strikingly, we find that E756del, a mild GOF PIEZO1 allele present in 
      one-third of individuals of African descent, is strongly associated with increased 
      plasma iron. Our study links macrophage mechanotransduction to iron metabolism and 
      identifies a genetic risk factor for increased iron levels in African Americans.

AB  - Tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells (TIMs) are key regulators in tumor progression, but 
      the similarity and distinction of their fundamental properties across different 
      tumors remain elusive. Here, by performing a pan-cancer analysis of single myeloid 
      cells from 210 patients across 15 human cancer types, we identified distinct 
      features of TIMs across cancer types. Mast cells in nasopharyngeal cancer were found 
      to be associated with better prognosis and exhibited an anti-tumor phenotype with a 
      high ratio of TNF(+)/VEGFA(+) cells. Systematic comparison between cDC1- and 
      cDC2-derived LAMP3(+) cDCs revealed their differences in transcription factors and 
      external stimulus. Additionally, pro-angiogenic tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) 
      were characterized with diverse markers across different cancer types, and the 
      composition of TIMs appeared to be associated with certain features of somatic 
      mutations and gene expressions. Our results provide a systematic view of the highly 
      heterogeneous TIMs and suggest future avenues for rational, targeted 
      immunotherapies.

AB  - Plants protect themselves with a vast array of toxic secondary metabolites, yet most 
      plants serve as food for insects. The evolutionary processes that allow herbivorous 
      insects to resist plant defenses remain largely unknown. The whitefly Bemisia tabaci 
      is a cosmopolitan, highly polyphagous agricultural pest that vectors several serious 
      plant pathogenic viruses and is an excellent model to probe the molecular mechanisms 
      involved in overcoming plant defenses. Here, we show that, through an exceptional 
      horizontal gene transfer event, the whitefly has acquired the plant-derived phenolic 
      glucoside malonyltransferase gene BtPMaT1. This gene enables whiteflies to 
      neutralize phenolic glucosides. This was confirmed by genetically transforming 
      tomato plants to produce small interfering RNAs that silence BtPMaT1, thus impairing 
      the whiteflies' detoxification ability. These findings reveal an evolutionary 
      scenario whereby herbivores harness the genetic toolkit of their host plants to 
      develop resistance to plant defenses and how this can be exploited for crop 
      protection.

AB  - In neutrophils, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) generated via 
      the pentose phosphate pathway fuels NADPH oxidase NOX2 to produce reactive oxygen 
      species for killing invading pathogens. However, excessive NOX2 activity can 
      exacerbate inflammation, as in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Here, we 
      use two unbiased chemical proteomic strategies to show that small-molecule LDC7559, 
      or a more potent designed analog NA-11, inhibits the NOX2-dependent oxidative burst 
      in neutrophils by activating the glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase-1 liver type 
      (PFKL) and dampening flux through the pentose phosphate pathway. Accordingly, 
      neutrophils treated with NA-11 had reduced NOX2-dependent outputs, including 
      neutrophil cell death (NETosis) and tissue damage. A high-resolution structure of 
      PFKL confirmed binding of NA-11 to the AMP/ADP allosteric activation site and 
      explained why NA-11 failed to agonize phosphofructokinase-1 platelet type (PFKP) or 
      muscle type (PFKM). Thus, NA-11 represents a tool for selective activation of PFKL, 
      the main phosphofructokinase-1 isoform expressed in immune cells.

AB  - Alphaviruses cause severe arthritogenic or encephalitic disease. The E1 structural 
      glycoprotein is highly conserved in these viruses and mediates viral fusion with 
      host cells. However, the role of antibody responses to the E1 protein in immunity is 
      poorly understood. We isolated E1-specific human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with 
      diverse patterns of recognition for alphaviruses (ranging from Eastern equine 
      encephalitis virus [EEEV]-specific to alphavirus cross-reactive) from survivors of 
      natural EEEV infection. Antibody binding patterns and epitope mapping experiments 
      identified differences in E1 reactivity based on exposure of epitopes on the 
      glycoprotein through pH-dependent mechanisms or presentation on the cell surface 
      prior to virus egress. Therapeutic efficacy in vivo of these mAbs corresponded with 
      potency of virus egress inhibition in vitro and did not require Fc-mediated effector 
      functions for treatment against subcutaneous EEEV challenge. These studies reveal 
      the molecular basis for broad and protective antibody responses to alphavirus E1 
      proteins.

AB  - Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are the sole output neurons that transmit visual 
      information from the retina to the brain. Diverse insults and pathological states 
      cause degeneration of RGC somas and axons leading to irreversible vision loss. A 
      fundamental question is whether manipulation of a key regulator of RGC survival can 
      protect RGCs from diverse insults and pathological states, and ultimately preserve 
      vision. Here, we report that CaMKII-CREB signaling is compromised after excitotoxic 
      injury to RGC somas or optic nerve injury to RGC axons, and reactivation of this 
      pathway robustly protects RGCs from both injuries. CaMKII activity also promotes RGC 
      survival in the normal retina. Further, reactivation of CaMKII protects RGCs in two 
      glaucoma models where RGCs degenerate from elevated intraocular pressure or genetic 
      deficiency. Last, CaMKII reactivation protects long-distance RGC axon projections 
      in vivo and preserves visual function, from the retina to the visual cortex, and 
      visually guided behavior.

AB  - Significant evidence supports the view that dopamine shapes learning by encoding 
      reward prediction errors. However, it is unknown whether striatal targets receive 
      tailored dopamine dynamics based on regional functional specialization. Here, we 
      report wave-like spatiotemporal activity patterns in dopamine axons and release 
      across the dorsal striatum. These waves switch between activational motifs and 
      organize dopamine transients into localized clusters within functionally related 
      striatal subregions. Notably, wave trajectories were tailored to task demands, 
      propagating from dorsomedial to dorsolateral striatum when rewards are contingent on 
      animal behavior and in the opponent direction when rewards are independent of 
      behavioral responses. We propose a computational architecture in which striatal 
      dopamine waves are sculpted by inference about agency and provide a mechanism to 
      direct credit assignment to specialized striatal subregions. Supporting model 
      predictions, dorsomedial dopamine activity during reward-pursuit signaled the extent 
      of instrumental control and interacted with reward waves to predict future 
      behavioral adjustments.

AB  - Sarcomeres are force-generating and load-bearing devices of muscles. A precise 
      molecular picture of how sarcomeres are built underpins understanding their role in 
      health and disease. Here, we determine the molecular architecture of native 
      vertebrate skeletal sarcomeres by electron cryo-tomography. Our reconstruction 
      reveals molecular details of the three-dimensional organization and interaction of 
      actin and myosin in the A-band, I-band, and Z-disc and demonstrates that α-actinin 
      cross-links antiparallel actin filaments by forming doublets with 6-nm spacing. 
      Structures of myosin, tropomyosin, and actin at ~10 Å further reveal two 
      conformations of the "double-head" myosin, where the flexible orientation of the 
      lever arm and light chains enable myosin not only to interact with the same actin 
      filament, but also to split between two actin filaments. Our results provide 
      unexpected insights into the fundamental organization of vertebrate skeletal muscle 
      and serve as a strong foundation for future investigations of muscle diseases.

AB  - Speech perception is thought to rely on a cortical feedforward serial transformation 
      of acoustic into linguistic representations. Using intracranial recordings across 
      the entire human auditory cortex, electrocortical stimulation, and surgical 
      ablation, we show that cortical processing across areas is not consistent with a 
      serial hierarchical organization. Instead, response latency and receptive field 
      analyses demonstrate parallel and distinct information processing in the primary and 
      nonprimary auditory cortices. This functional dissociation was also observed where 
      stimulation of the primary auditory cortex evokes auditory hallucination but does 
      not distort or interfere with speech perception. Opposite effects were observed 
      during stimulation of nonprimary cortex in superior temporal gyrus. Ablation of the 
      primary auditory cortex does not affect speech perception. These results establish a 
      distributed functional organization of parallel information processing throughout 
      the human auditory cortex and demonstrate an essential independent role for 
      nonprimary auditory cortex in speech processing.

AB  - Biomolecular condensation is a widespread mechanism of cellular 
      compartmentalization. Because the "survival of motor neuron protein" (SMN) is 
      implicated in the formation of three different membraneless organelles (MLOs), we 
      hypothesized that SMN promotes condensation. Unexpectedly, we found that SMN's 
      globular tudor domain was sufficient for dimerization-induced condensation in vivo, 
      whereas its two intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) were not. Binding to 
      dimethylarginine (DMA) modified protein ligands was required for condensate 
      formation by the tudor domains in SMN and at least seven other fly and human 
      proteins. Remarkably, asymmetric versus symmetric DMA determined whether two 
      distinct nuclear MLOs-gems and Cajal bodies-were separate or "docked" to one 
      another. This substructure depended on the presence of either asymmetric or 
      symmetric DMA as visualized with sub-diffraction microscopy. Thus, DMA-tudor 
      interaction modules-combinations of tudor domains bound to their DMA 
      ligand(s)-represent versatile yet specific regulators of MLO assembly, composition, 
      and morphology.

AB  - The mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) is a key midbrain center with roles in 
      locomotion. Despite extensive studies and clinical trials aimed at therapy-resistant 
      Parkinson's disease (PD), debate on its function remains. Here, we reveal the 
      existence of functionally diverse neuronal populations with distinct roles in 
      control of body movements. We identify two spatially intermingled glutamatergic 
      populations separable by axonal projections, mouse genetics, neuronal activity 
      profiles, and motor functions. Most spinally projecting MLR neurons encoded the 
      full-body behavior rearing. Loss- and gain-of-function optogenetic perturbation 
      experiments establish a function for these neurons in controlling body extension. In 
      contrast, Rbp4-transgene-positive MLR neurons project in an ascending direction to 
      basal ganglia, preferentially encode the forelimb behaviors handling and grooming, 
      and exhibit a role in modulating movement. Thus, the MLR contains glutamatergic 
      neuronal subpopulations stratified by projection target exhibiting roles in action 
      control not restricted to locomotion.

AB  - The microbiota plays a fundamental role in regulating host immunity. However, the 
      processes involved in the initiation and regulation of immunity to the microbiota 
      remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the skin microbiota promotes the discrete 
      expression of defined endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). Keratinocyte-intrinsic 
      responses to ERVs depended on cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)/stimulator of 
      interferon genes protein (STING) signaling and promoted the induction of 
      commensal-specific T cells. Inhibition of ERV reverse transcription significantly 
      impacted these responses, resulting in impaired immunity to the microbiota and its 
      associated tissue repair function. Conversely, a lipid-enriched diet primed the skin 
      for heightened ERV- expression in response to commensal colonization, leading to 
      increased immune responses and tissue inflammation. Together, our results support 
      the idea that the host may have co-opted its endogenous virome as a means to 
      communicate with the exogenous microbiota, resulting in a multi-kingdom dialog that 
      controls both tissue homeostasis and inflammation.

AB  - Lateral intraparietal (LIP) neurons represent formation of perceptual decisions 
      involving eye movements. In circuit models for these decisions, neural ensembles 
      that encode actions compete to form decisions. Consequently, representation and 
      readout of the decision variables (DVs) are implemented similarly for decisions with 
      identical competing actions, irrespective of input and task context differences. 
      Further, DVs are encoded as partially potentiated action plans through balance of 
      activity of action-selective ensembles. Here, we test those core principles. We show 
      that in a novel face-discrimination task, LIP firing rates decrease with supporting 
      evidence, contrary to conventional motion-discrimination tasks. These opposite 
      response patterns arise from similar mechanisms in which decisions form along curved 
      population-response manifolds misaligned with action representations. These 
      manifolds rotate in state space based on context, indicating distinct optimal 
      readouts for different tasks. We show similar manifolds in lateral and medial 
      prefrontal cortices, suggesting similar representational geometry across 
      decision-making circuits.

AB  - Organoids capable of forming tissue-like structures have transformed our ability to 
      model human development and disease. With the notable exception of the human heart, 
      lineage-specific self-organizing organoids have been reported for all major organs. 
      Here, we established self-organizing cardioids from human pluripotent stem cells 
      that intrinsically specify, pattern, and morph into chamber-like structures 
      containing a cavity. Cardioid complexity can be controlled by signaling that 
      instructs the separation of cardiomyocyte and endothelial layers and by directing 
      epicardial spreading, inward migration, and differentiation. We find that cavity 
      morphogenesis is governed by a mesodermal WNT-BMP signaling axis and requires its 
      target HAND1, a transcription factor linked to developmental heart chamber defects. 
      Upon cryoinjury, cardioids initiated a cell-type-dependent accumulation of 
      extracellular matrix, an early hallmark of both regeneration and heart disease. 
      Thus, human cardioids represent a powerful platform to mechanistically dissect 
      self-organization, congenital heart defects and serve as a foundation for future 
      translational research.

AB  - Throughout development and aging, human cells accumulate mutations resulting in 
      genomic mosaicism and genetic diversity at the cellular level. Mosaic mutations 
      present in the gonads can affect both the individual and the offspring and 
      subsequent generations. Here, we explore patterns and temporal stability of clonal 
      mosaic mutations in male gonads by sequencing ejaculated sperm. Through 300× 
      whole-genome sequencing of blood and sperm from healthy men, we find each ejaculate 
      carries on average 33.3 ± 12.1 (mean ± SD) clonal mosaic variants, nearly all of 
      which are detected in serial sampling, with the majority absent from sampled somal 
      tissues. Their temporal stability and mutational signature suggest origins during 
      embryonic development from a largely immutable stem cell niche. Clonal mosaicism 
      likely contributes a transmissible, predicted pathogenic exonic variant for 1 in 15 
      men, representing a life-long threat of transmission for these individuals and a 
      significant burden on human population health.

TI  - In vitro and in vivo functions of SARS-CoV-2 infection-enhancing and neutralizing 
      antibodies.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) protect against COVID-19. A concern 
      regarding SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is whether they mediate disease enhancement. Here, 
      we isolated NAbs against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) or the N-terminal domain 
      (NTD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike from individuals with acute or convalescent SARS-CoV-2 or 
      a history of SARS-CoV infection. Cryo-electron microscopy of RBD and NTD antibodies 
      demonstrated function-specific modes of binding. Select RBD NAbs also demonstrated 
      Fc receptor-γ (FcγR)-mediated enhancement of virus infection in vitro, while five 
      non-neutralizing NTD antibodies mediated FcγR-independent in vitro infection 
      enhancement. However, both types of infection-enhancing antibodies protected from 
      SARS-CoV-2 replication in monkeys and mice. Three of 46 monkeys infused with 
      enhancing antibodies had higher lung inflammation scores compared to controls. One 
      monkey had alveolar edema and elevated bronchoalveolar lavage inflammatory 
      cytokines. Thus, while in vitro antibody-enhanced infection does not necessarily 
      herald enhanced infection in vivo, increased lung inflammation can rarely occur in 
      SARS-CoV-2 antibody-infused macaques.

AB  - Stony corals are colonial cnidarians that sustain the most biodiverse marine 
      ecosystems on Earth: coral reefs. Despite their ecological importance, little is 
      known about the cell types and molecular pathways that underpin the biology of 
      reef-building corals. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we define over 40 cell types 
      across the life cycle of Stylophora pistillata. We discover specialized immune 
      cells, and we uncover the developmental gene expression dynamics of 
      calcium-carbonate skeleton formation. By simultaneously measuring the transcriptomes 
      of coral cells and the algae within them, we characterize the metabolic programs 
      involved in symbiosis in both partners. We also trace the evolution of these coral 
      cell specializations by phylogenetic integration of multiple cnidarian cell type 
      atlases. Overall, this study reveals the molecular and cellular basis of stony coral 
      biology.

TI  - Early introductions and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 in the United 
      States.

AB  - The emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.7, first detected in the United 
      Kingdom, has become a global public health concern because of its increased 
      transmissibility. Over 2,500 COVID-19 cases associated with this variant have been 
      detected in the United States (US) since December 2020, but the extent of 
      establishment is relatively unknown. Using travel, genomic, and diagnostic data, we 
      highlight that the primary ports of entry for B.1.1.7 in the US were in New York, 
      California, and Florida. Furthermore, we found evidence for many independent B.1.1.7 
      establishments starting in early December 2020, followed by interstate spread by the 
      end of the month. Finally, we project that B.1.1.7 will be the dominant lineage in 
      many states by mid- to late March. Thus, genomic surveillance for B.1.1.7 and other 
      variants urgently needs to be enhanced to better inform the public health response.

      found that indel generation by Cas9 and guide RNA can occur at steady rates, in 
      contrast to typical dynamic biological reactions, and the accumulated indel 
      frequency can be a function of time. By measuring indel frequencies, we developed a 
      method for recording and measuring absolute time periods over hours to weeks in 
      mammalian cells. These time-recordings were conducted in several cell types, with 
      different promoters and delivery vectors for Cas9, and in both cultured cells and 
      cells of living mice. As applications, we recorded the duration of chemical exposure 
      and the lengths of elapsed time since the onset of biological events (e.g., heat 
      exposure and inflammation). We propose that our systems could serve as synthetic 
      "DNA clocks."

AB  - It is unclear how binding of antidepressant drugs to their targets gives rise to the 
      clinical antidepressant effect. We discovered that the transmembrane domain of 
      tyrosine kinase receptor 2 (TRKB), the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) 
      receptor that promotes neuronal plasticity and antidepressant responses, has a 
      cholesterol-sensing function that mediates synaptic effects of cholesterol. We then 
      found that both typical and fast-acting antidepressants directly bind to TRKB, 
      thereby facilitating synaptic localization of TRKB and its activation by BDNF. 
      Extensive computational approaches including atomistic molecular dynamics 
      simulations revealed a binding site at the transmembrane region of TRKB dimers. 
      Mutation of the TRKB antidepressant-binding motif impaired cellular, behavioral, and 
      plasticity-promoting responses to antidepressants in vitro and in vivo. We suggest 
      that binding to TRKB and allosteric facilitation of BDNF signaling is the common 
      mechanism for antidepressant action, which may explain why typical antidepressants 
      act slowly and how molecular effects of antidepressants are translated into clinical 
      mood recovery.

TI  - Control of gasdermin D oligomerization and pyroptosis by the Ragulator-Rag-mTORC1 
      pathway.

AB  - The process of pyroptosis is mediated by inflammasomes and a downstream effector 
      known as gasdermin D (GSDMD). Upon cleavage by inflammasome-associated caspases, the 
      N-terminal domain of GSDMD forms membrane pores that promote cytolysis. Numerous 
      proteins promote GSDMD cleavage, but none are known to be required for pore 
      formation after GSDMD cleavage. Herein, we report a forward genetic screen that 
      identified the Ragulator-Rag complex as being necessary for GSDMD pore formation and 
      pyroptosis in macrophages. Mechanistic analysis revealed that Ragulator-Rag is not 
      required for GSDMD cleavage upon inflammasome activation but rather promotes GSDMD 
      oligomerization in the plasma membrane. Defects in GSDMD oligomerization and pore 
      formation can be rescued by mitochondrial poisons that stimulate reactive oxygen 
      species (ROS) production, and ROS modulation impacts the ability of inflammasome 
      pathways to promote pore formation downstream of GSDMD cleavage. These findings 
      reveal an unexpected link between key regulators of immunity (inflammasome-GSDMD) 
      and metabolism (Ragulator-Rag).

AB  - Sneezing is a vital respiratory reflex frequently associated with allergic rhinitis 
      and viral respiratory infections. However, its neural circuit remains largely 
      unknown. A sneeze-evoking region was discovered in both cat and human brainstems, 
      corresponding anatomically to the central recipient zone of nasal sensory neurons. 
      Therefore, we hypothesized that a neuronal population postsynaptic to nasal sensory 
      neurons mediates sneezing in this region. By screening major presynaptic 
      neurotransmitters/neuropeptides released by nasal sensory neurons, we found that 
      neuromedin B (NMB) peptide is essential for signaling sneezing. Ablation of 
      NMB-sensitive postsynaptic neurons in the sneeze-evoking region or deficiency in NMB 
      receptor abolished the sneezing reflex. Remarkably, NMB-sensitive neurons further 
      project to the caudal ventral respiratory group (cVRG). Chemical activation of 
      NMB-sensitive neurons elicits action potentials in cVRG neurons and leads to 
      sneezing behavior. Our study delineates a peptidergic pathway mediating sneezing, 
      providing molecular insights into the sneezing reflex arc.

AB  - The core symptoms of many neurological disorders have traditionally been thought to 
      be caused by genetic variants affecting brain development and function. However, the 
      gut microbiome, another important source of variation, can also influence specific 
      behaviors. Thus, it is critical to unravel the contributions of host genetic 
      variation, the microbiome, and their interactions to complex behaviors. 
      Unexpectedly, we discovered that different maladaptive behaviors are 
      interdependently regulated by the microbiome and host genes in the Cntnap2(-/-) 
      model for neurodevelopmental disorders. The hyperactivity phenotype of Cntnap2(-/-) 
      mice is caused by host genetics, whereas the social-behavior phenotype is mediated 
      by the gut microbiome. Interestingly, specific microbial intervention selectively 
      rescued the social deficits in Cntnap2(-/-) mice through upregulation of metabolites 
      in the tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis pathway. Our findings that behavioral 
      abnormalities could have distinct origins (host genetic versus microbial) may change 
      the way we think about neurological disorders and how to treat them.

AB  - The choroid plexus (ChP) in each brain ventricle produces cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
      and forms the blood-CSF barrier. Here, we construct a single-cell and spatial atlas 
      of each ChP in the developing, adult, and aged mouse brain. We delineate diverse 
      cell types, subtypes, cell states, and expression programs in epithelial and 
      mesenchymal cells across ages and ventricles. In the developing ChP, we predict a 
      common progenitor pool for epithelial and neuronal cells, validated by lineage 
      tracing. Epithelial and fibroblast cells show regionalized expression by ventricle, 
      starting at embryonic stages and persisting with age, with a dramatic 
      transcriptional shift with maturation, and a smaller shift in each aged cell type. 
      With aging, epithelial cells upregulate host-defense programs, and resident 
      macrophages upregulate interleukin-1β (IL-1β) signaling genes. Our atlas reveals 
      cellular diversity, architecture and signaling across ventricles during development, 
      maturation, and aging of the ChP-brain barrier.

AB  - TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) regulates IFN-I, NF-κB, and TNF-induced RIPK1-dependent 
      cell death (RCD). In mice, biallelic loss of TBK1 is embryonically lethal. We 
      discovered four humans, ages 32, 26, 7, and 8 from three unrelated consanguineous 
      families with homozygous loss-of-function mutations in TBK1. All four patients 
      suffer from chronic and systemic autoinflammation, but not severe viral infections. 
      We demonstrate that TBK1 loss results in hypomorphic but sufficient IFN-I induction 
      via RIG-I/MDA5, while the system retains near intact IL-6 induction through NF-κB. 
      Autoinflammation is driven by TNF-induced RCD as patient-derived fibroblasts 
      experienced higher rates of necroptosis in vitro, and CC3 was elevated in peripheral 
      blood ex vivo. Treatment with anti-TNF dampened the baseline circulating 
      inflammatory profile and ameliorated the clinical condition in vivo. These findings 
      highlight the plasticity of the IFN-I response and underscore a cardinal role for 
      TBK1 in the regulation of RCD.

AB  - Understanding the functional consequences of single-nucleotide variants is critical 
      to uncovering the genetic underpinnings of diseases, but technologies to 
      characterize variants are limiting. Here, we leverage CRISPR-Cas9 cytosine base 
      editors in pooled screens to scalably assay variants at endogenous loci in mammalian 
      cells. We benchmark the performance of base editors in positive and negative 
      selection screens, identifying known loss-of-function mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 
      with high precision. To demonstrate the utility of base editor screens to probe 
      small molecule-protein interactions, we screen against BH3 mimetics and PARP 
      inhibitors, identifying point mutations that confer drug sensitivity or resistance. 
      We also create a library of single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) predicted to generate 52,034 
      ClinVar variants in 3,584 genes and conduct screens in the presence of cellular 
      stressors, identifying loss-of-function variants in numerous DNA damage repair 
      genes. We anticipate that this screening approach will be broadly useful to readily 
      and scalably functionalize genetic variants.

AB  - Changes in appendage structure underlie key transitions in vertebrate evolution. 
      Addition of skeletal elements along the proximal-distal axis facilitated critical 
      transformations, including the fin-to-limb transition that permitted generation of 
      diverse modes of locomotion. Here, we identify zebrafish mutants that form 
      supernumerary long bones in their pectoral fins. These new bones integrate into 
      musculature, form joints, and articulate with neighboring elements. This phenotype 
      is caused by activating mutations in previously unrecognized regulators of appendage 
      patterning, vav2 and waslb, that function in a common pathway. This pathway is 
      required for appendage development across vertebrates, and loss of Wasl in mice 
      causes defects similar to those seen in murine Hox mutants. Concordantly, formation 
      of supernumerary bones requires Hox11 function, and mutations in the vav2/wasl 
      pathway drive enhanced expression of hoxa11b, indicating developmental homology with 
      the forearm. Our findings reveal a latent, limb-like pattern ability in fins that is 
      activated by simple genetic perturbation.

AB  - Cutaneous mast cells mediate numerous skin inflammatory processes and have 
      anatomical and functional associations with sensory afferent neurons. We reveal that 
      epidermal nerve endings from a subset of sensory nonpeptidergic neurons expressing 
      MrgprD are reduced by the absence of Langerhans cells. Loss of epidermal innervation 
      or ablation of MrgprD-expressing neurons increased expression of a mast cell gene 
      module, including the activating receptor, Mrgprb2, resulting in increased mast cell 
      degranulation and cutaneous inflammation in multiple disease models. Agonism of 
      MrgprD-expressing neurons reduced expression of module genes and suppressed mast 
      cell responses. MrgprD-expressing neurons released glutamate which was increased by 
      MrgprD agonism. Inhibiting glutamate release or glutamate receptor binding yielded 
      hyperresponsive mast cells with a genomic state similar to that in mice lacking 
      MrgprD-expressing neurons. These data demonstrate that MrgprD-expressing neurons 
      suppress mast cell hyperresponsiveness and skin inflammation via glutamate release, 
      thereby revealing an unexpected neuroimmune mechanism maintaining cutaneous immune 
      homeostasis.

AB  - Embryo morphogenesis is impacted by dynamic changes in tissue material properties, 
      which have been proposed to occur via processes akin to phase transitions (PTs). 
      Here, we show that rigidity percolation provides a simple and robust theoretical 
      framework to predict material/structural PTs of embryonic tissues from local cell 
      connectivity. By using percolation theory, combined with directly monitoring dynamic 
      changes in tissue rheology and cell contact mechanics, we demonstrate that the 
      zebrafish blastoderm undergoes a genuine rigidity PT, brought about by a small 
      reduction in adhesion-dependent cell connectivity below a critical value. We 
      quantitatively predict and experimentally verify hallmarks of PTs, including 
      power-law exponents and associated discontinuities of macroscopic observables. 
      Finally, we show that this uniform PT depends on blastoderm cells undergoing 
      meta-synchronous divisions causing random and, consequently, uniform changes in cell 
      connectivity. Collectively, our theoretical and experimental findings reveal the 
      structural basis of material PTs in an organismal context.

AB  - Regulatory T cells prevent the emergence of autoantibodies and excessive IgE, but 
      the precise mechanisms are unclear. Here, we show that BCL6-expressing Tregs, known 
      as follicular regulatory T (Tfr) cells, produce abundant neuritin protein that 
      targets B cells. Mice lacking Tfr cells or neuritin in Foxp3-expressing cells 
      accumulated early plasma cells in germinal centers (GCs) and developed 
      autoantibodies against histones and tissue-specific self-antigens. Upon 
      immunization, these mice also produced increased plasma IgE and IgG1. We show that 
      neuritin is taken up by B cells, causes phosphorylation of numerous proteins, and 
      dampens IgE class switching. Neuritin reduced differentiation of mouse and human GC 
      B cells into plasma cells, downregulated BLIMP-1, and upregulated BCL6. 
      Administration of neuritin to Tfr-deficient mice prevented the accumulation of early 
      plasma cells in GCs. Production of neuritin by Tfr cells emerges as a central 
      mechanism to suppress B cell-driven autoimmunity and IgE-mediated allergies.

AB  - The hippocampus is thought to encode a "cognitive map," a structural organization of 
      knowledge about relationships in the world. Place cells, spatially selective 
      hippocampal neurons that have been extensively studied in rodents, are one component 
      of this map, describing the relative position of environmental features. However, 
      whether this map extends to abstract, cognitive information remains unknown. Using 
      the relative reward value of cues to define continuous "paths" through an abstract 
      value space, we show that single neurons in primate hippocampus encode this space 
      through value place fields, much like a rodent's place neurons encode paths through 
      physical space. Value place fields remapped when cues changed but also became 
      increasingly correlated across contexts, allowing maps to become generalized. Our 
      findings help explain the critical contribution of the hippocampus to value-based 
      decision-making, providing a mechanism by which knowledge of relationships in the 
      world can be incorporated into reward predictions for guiding decisions.

AB  - How early events in effector T cell (T(EFF)) subsets tune memory T cell (T(MEM)) 
      responses remains incompletely understood. Here, we systematically investigated 
      metabolic factors in fate determination of T(EFF) and T(MEM) cells using in vivo 
      pooled CRISPR screening, focusing on negative regulators of T(MEM) responses. We 
      found that amino acid transporters Slc7a1 and Slc38a2 dampened the magnitude of 
      T(MEM) differentiation, in part through modulating mTORC1 signaling. By integrating 
      genetic and systems approaches, we identified cellular and metabolic heterogeneity 
      among T(EFF) cells, with terminal effector differentiation associated with 
      establishment of metabolic quiescence and exit from the cell cycle. Importantly, 
      Pofut1 (protein-O-fucosyltransferase-1) linked GDP-fucose availability to downstream 
      Notch-Rbpj signaling, and perturbation of this nutrient signaling axis blocked 
      terminal effector differentiation but drove context-dependent T(EFF) proliferation 
      and T(MEM) development. Our study establishes that nutrient uptake and signaling are 
      key determinants of T cell fate and shape the quantity and quality of T(MEM) 
      responses.

AB  - Ligand-gated ion channels mediate signal transduction at chemical synapses and 
      transition between resting, open, and desensitized states in response to 
      neurotransmitter binding. Neurotransmitters that produce maximum open channel 
      probabilities (Po) are full agonists, whereas those that yield lower than maximum Po 
      are partial agonists. Cys-loop receptors are an important class of neurotransmitter 
      receptors, yet a structure-based understanding of the mechanism of partial agonist 
      action has proven elusive. Here, we study the glycine receptor with the full agonist 
      glycine and the partial agonists taurine and γ-amino butyric acid (GABA). We use 
      electrophysiology to show how partial agonists populate agonist-bound, closed 
      channel states and cryo-EM reconstructions to illuminate the structures of 
      intermediate, pre-open states, providing insights into previously unseen 
      conformational states along the receptor reaction pathway. We further correlate 
      agonist-induced conformational changes to Po across members of the receptor family, 
      providing a hypothetical mechanism for partial and full agonist action at Cys-loop 
      receptors.

AB  - Defining long-term protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is one of the most pressing 
      questions of our time and will require a detailed understanding of potential ways 
      this virus can evolve to escape immune protection. Immune protection will most 
      likely be mediated by antibodies that bind to the viral entry protein, spike (S). 
      Here, we used Phage-DMS, an approach that comprehensively interrogates the effect of 
      all possible mutations on binding to a protein of interest, to define the profile of 
      antibody escape to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein using coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19) convalescent plasma. Antibody binding was common in two regions, the 
      fusion peptide and the linker region upstream of the heptad repeat region 2. 
      However, escape mutations were variable within these immunodominant regions. There 
      was also individual variation in less commonly targeted epitopes. This study 
      provides a granular view of potential antibody escape pathways and suggests there 
      will be individual variation in antibody-mediated virus evolution.

AB  - The 501Y.V2 variants of SARS-CoV-2 containing multiple mutations in spike are now 
      dominant in South Africa and are rapidly spreading to other countries. Here, 
      experiments with 18 pseudotyped viruses showed that the 501Y.V2 variants do not 
      confer increased infectivity in multiple cell types except for murine 
      ACE2-overexpressing cells, where a substantial increase in infectivity was observed. 
      Notably, the susceptibility of the 501Y.V2 variants to 12 of 17 neutralizing 
      monoclonal antibodies was substantially diminished, and the neutralization ability 
      of the sera from convalescent patients and immunized mice was also reduced for these 
      variants. The neutralization resistance was mainly caused by E484K and N501Y 
      mutations in the receptor-binding domain of spike. The enhanced infectivity in 
      murine ACE2-overexpressing cells suggests the possibility of spillover of the 
      501Y.V2 variants to mice. Moreover, the neutralization resistance we detected for 
      the 501Y.V2 variants suggests the potential for compromised efficacy of monoclonal 
      antibodies and vaccines.

AB  - The oral mucosa remains an understudied barrier tissue. This is a site of rich 
      exposure to antigens and commensals, and a tissue susceptible to one of the most 
      prevalent human inflammatory diseases, periodontitis. To aid in understanding 
      tissue-specific pathophysiology, we compile a single-cell transcriptome atlas of 
      human oral mucosa in healthy individuals and patients with periodontitis. We uncover 
      the complex cellular landscape of oral mucosal tissues and identify epithelial and 
      stromal cell populations with inflammatory signatures that promote antimicrobial 
      defenses and neutrophil recruitment. Our findings link exaggerated stromal cell 
      responsiveness with enhanced neutrophil and leukocyte infiltration in periodontitis. 
      Our work provides a resource characterizing the role of tissue stroma in regulating 
      mucosal tissue homeostasis and disease pathogenesis.

AB  - Metabolism is a major regulator of immune cell function, but it remains difficult to 
      study the metabolic status of individual cells. Here, we present Compass, an 
      algorithm to characterize cellular metabolic states based on single-cell RNA 
      sequencing and flux balance analysis. We applied Compass to associate metabolic 
      states with T helper 17 (Th17) functional variability (pathogenic potential) and 
      recovered a metabolic switch between glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation, akin to 
      known Th17/regulatory T cell (Treg) differences, which we validated by metabolic 
      assays. Compass also predicted that Th17 pathogenicity was associated with arginine 
      and downstream polyamine metabolism. Indeed, polyamine-related enzyme expression was 
      enhanced in pathogenic Th17 and suppressed in Treg cells. Chemical and genetic 
      perturbation of polyamine metabolism inhibited Th17 cytokines, promoted Foxp3 
      expression, and remodeled the transcriptome and epigenome of Th17 cells toward a 
      Treg-like state. In vivo perturbations of the polyamine pathway altered the 
      phenotype of encephalitogenic T cells and attenuated tissue inflammation in CNS 
      autoimmunity.

AB  - The human fetal immune system begins to develop early during gestation; however, 
      factors responsible for fetal immune-priming remain elusive. We explored potential 
      exposure to microbial agents in utero and their contribution toward activation of 
      memory T cells in fetal tissues. We profiled microbes across fetal organs using 16S 
      rRNA gene sequencing and detected low but consistent microbial signal in fetal gut, 
      skin, placenta, and lungs in the 2(nd) trimester of gestation. We identified several 
      live bacterial strains including Staphylococcus and Lactobacillus in fetal tissues, 
      which induced in vitro activation of memory T cells in fetal mesenteric lymph node, 
      supporting the role of microbial exposure in fetal immune-priming. Finally, using 
      SEM and RNA-ISH, we visualized discrete localization of bacteria-like structures and 
      eubacterial-RNA within 14(th) weeks fetal gut lumen. These findings indicate 
      selective presence of live microbes in fetal organs during the 2(nd) trimester of 
      gestation and have broader implications toward the establishment of immune 
      competency and priming before birth.

AB  - Antibacterial agents target the products of essential genes but rarely achieve 
      complete target inhibition. Thus, the all-or-none definition of essentiality 
      afforded by traditional genetic approaches fails to discern the most attractive 
      bacterial targets: those whose incomplete inhibition results in major fitness costs. 
      In contrast, gene "vulnerability" is a continuous, quantifiable trait that relates 
      the magnitude of gene inhibition to the effect on bacterial fitness. We developed a 
      CRISPR interference-based functional genomics method to systematically titrate gene 
      expression in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and monitor fitness outcomes. We 
      identified highly vulnerable genes in various processes, including novel targets 
      unexplored for drug discovery. Equally important, we identified invulnerable 
      essential genes, potentially explaining failed drug discovery efforts. Comparison of 
      vulnerability between the reference and a hypervirulent Mtb isolate revealed 
      incomplete conservation of vulnerability and that differential vulnerability can 
      predict differential antibacterial susceptibility. Our results quantitatively 
      redefine essential bacterial processes and identify high-value targets for drug 
      development.

AB  - Alphaviruses are emerging, mosquito-transmitted pathogens that cause musculoskeletal 
      and neurological disease in humans. Although neutralizing antibodies that inhibit 
      individual alphaviruses have been described, broadly reactive antibodies that 
      protect against both arthritogenic and encephalitic alphaviruses have not been 
      reported. Here, we identify DC2.112 and DC2.315, two pan-protective yet poorly 
      neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that avidly bind to viral antigen on 
      the surface of cells infected with arthritogenic and encephalitic alphaviruses. 
      These mAbs engage a conserved epitope in domain II of the E1 protein proximal to and 
      within the fusion peptide. Treatment with DC2.112 or DC2.315 protects mice against 
      infection by both arthritogenic (chikungunya and Mayaro) and encephalitic 
      (Venezuelan, Eastern, and Western equine encephalitis) alphaviruses through multiple 
      mechanisms, including inhibition of viral egress and monocyte-dependent Fc effector 
      functions. These findings define a conserved epitope recognized by weakly 
      neutralizing yet protective antibodies that could be targeted for pan-alphavirus 
      immunotherapy and vaccine design.

AB  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a World Health Organization 
      priority pathogen. CCHFV infections cause a highly lethal hemorrhagic fever for 
      which specific treatments and vaccines are urgently needed. Here, we characterize 
      the human immune response to natural CCHFV infection to identify potent neutralizing 
      monoclonal antibodies (nAbs) targeting the viral glycoprotein. Competition 
      experiments showed that these nAbs bind six distinct antigenic sites in the Gc 
      subunit. These sites were further delineated through mutagenesis and mapped onto a 
      prefusion model of Gc. Pairwise screening identified combinations of non-competing 
      nAbs that afford synergistic neutralization. Further enhancements in neutralization 
      breadth and potency were attained by physically linking variable domains of 
      synergistic nAb pairs through bispecific antibody (bsAb) engineering. Although 
      multiple nAbs protected mice from lethal CCHFV challenge in pre- or post-exposure 
      prophylactic settings, only a single bsAb, DVD-121-801, afforded therapeutic 
      protection. DVD-121-801 is a promising candidate suitable for clinical development 
      as a CCHFV therapeutic.

AB  - Hedgehog pathway components and select G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) localize 
      to the primary cilium, an organelle specialized for signal transduction. We 
      investigated whether cells distinguish between ciliary and extraciliary GPCR 
      signaling. To test whether ciliary and extraciliary cyclic AMP (cAMP) convey 
      different information, we engineered optogenetic and chemogenetic tools to control 
      the subcellular site of cAMP generation. Generating equal amounts of ciliary and 
      cytoplasmic cAMP in zebrafish and mammalian cells revealed that ciliary cAMP, but 
      not cytoplasmic cAMP, inhibited Hedgehog signaling. Modeling suggested that the 
      distinct geometries of the cilium and cell body differentially activate local 
      effectors. The search for effectors identified a ciliary pool of protein kinase A 
      (PKA). Blocking the function of ciliary PKA, but not extraciliary PKA, activated 
      Hedgehog signal transduction and reversed the effects of ciliary cAMP. Therefore, 
      cells distinguish ciliary and extraciliary cAMP using functionally and spatially 
      distinct pools of PKA, and different subcellular pools of cAMP convey different 
      information.

AB  - All cells fold their genomes, including bacterial cells, where the chromosome is 
      compacted into a domain-organized meshwork called the nucleoid. How compaction and 
      domain organization arise is not fully understood. Here, we describe a method to 
      estimate the average mesh size of the nucleoid in Escherichia coli. Using nucleoid 
      mesh size and DNA concentration estimates, we find that the cytoplasm behaves as a 
      poor solvent for the chromosome when the cell is considered as a simple semidilute 
      polymer solution. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that a poor solvent leads to 
      chromosome compaction and DNA density heterogeneity (i.e., domain formation) at 
      physiological DNA concentration. Fluorescence microscopy reveals that the 
      heterogeneous DNA density negatively correlates with ribosome density within the 
      nucleoid, consistent with cryoelectron tomography data. Drug experiments, together 
      with past observations, suggest the hypothesis that RNAs contribute to the poor 
      solvent effects, connecting chromosome compaction and domain formation to 
      transcription and intracellular organization.

AB  - Electron cryotomography (cryoET), an electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM) modality, has 
      changed our understanding of biological function by revealing the native molecular 
      details of membranes, viruses, and cells. However, identification of individual 
      molecules within tomograms from cryoET is challenging because of sample crowding and 
      low signal-to-noise ratios. Here, we present a tagging strategy for cryoET that 
      precisely identifies individual protein complexes in tomograms without relying on 
      metal clusters. Our method makes use of DNA origami to produce "molecular signposts" 
      that target molecules of interest, here via fluorescent fusion proteins, providing a 
      platform generally applicable to biological surfaces. We demonstrate the specificity 
      of signpost origami tags (SPOTs) in vitro as well as their suitability for cryoET of 
      membrane vesicles, enveloped viruses, and the exterior of intact mammalian cells.

AB  - Cross-presentation of antigens from dead tumor cells by type 1 conventional 
      dendritic cells (cDC1s) is thought to underlie priming of anti-cancer CD8(+) 
      T cells. cDC1 express high levels of DNGR-1 (a.k.a. CLEC9A), a receptor that binds 
      to F-actin exposed by dead cell debris and promotes cross-presentation of associated 
      antigens. Here, we show that secreted gelsolin (sGSN), an extracellular protein, 
      decreases DNGR-1 binding to F-actin and cross-presentation of dead cell-associated 
      antigens by cDC1s. Mice deficient in sGsn display increased DNGR-1-dependent 
      resistance to transplantable tumors, especially ones expressing neoantigens 
      associated with the actin cytoskeleton, and exhibit greater responsiveness to cancer 
      immunotherapy. In human cancers, lower levels of intratumoral sGSN transcripts, as 
      well as presence of mutations in proteins associated with the actin cytoskeleton, 
      are associated with signatures of anti-cancer immunity and increased patient 
      survival. Our results reveal a natural barrier to cross-presentation of cancer 
      antigens that dampens anti-tumor CD8(+) T cell responses.

AB  - Many individuals mount nearly identical antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2. To gain 
      insight into how the viral spike (S) protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) might 
      evolve in response to common antibody responses, we studied mutations occurring 
      during virus evolution in a persistently infected immunocompromised individual. We 
      use antibody Fab/RBD structures to predict, and pseudotypes to confirm, that 
      mutations found in late-stage evolved S variants confer resistance to a common class 
      of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies we isolated from a healthy COVID-19 
      convalescent donor. Resistance extends to the polyclonal serum immunoglobulins of 
      four out of four healthy convalescent donors we tested and to monoclonal antibodies 
      in clinical use. We further show that affinity maturation is unimportant for 
      wild-type virus neutralization but is critical to neutralization breadth. Because 
      the mutations we studied foreshadowed emerging variants that are now circulating 
      across the globe, our results have implications to the long-term efficacy of 
      S-directed countermeasures.

AB  - Mutations in DNA damage response (DDR) genes endanger genome integrity and 
      predispose to cancer and genetic disorders. Here, using CRISPR-dependent cytosine 
      base editing screens, we identify > 2,000 sgRNAs that generate nucleotide variants 
      in 86 DDR genes, resulting in altered cellular fitness upon DNA damage. Among those 
      variants, we discover loss- and gain-of-function mutants in the Tudor domain of the 
      DDR regulator 53BP1 that define a non-canonical surface required for binding the 
      deubiquitinase USP28. Moreover, we characterize variants of the TRAIP ubiquitin 
      ligase that define a domain, whose loss renders cells resistant to topoisomerase I 
      inhibition. Finally, we identify mutations in the ATM kinase with opposing genome 
      stability phenotypes and loss-of-function mutations in the CHK2 kinase previously 
      categorized as variants of uncertain significance for breast cancer. We anticipate 
      that this resource will enable the discovery of additional DDR gene functions and 
      expedite studies of DDR variants in human disease.

AB  - Antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein 
      prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the effects of antibodies against other spike 
      protein domains are largely unknown. Here, we screened a series of anti-spike 
      monoclonal antibodies from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and found 
      that some of antibodies against the N-terminal domain (NTD) induced the open 
      conformation of RBD and thus enhanced the binding capacity of the spike protein to 
      ACE2 and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. Mutational analysis revealed that all of the 
      infectivity-enhancing antibodies recognized a specific site on the NTD. Structural 
      analysis demonstrated that all infectivity-enhancing antibodies bound to NTD in a 
      similar manner. The antibodies against this infectivity-enhancing site were detected 
      at high levels in severe patients. Moreover, we identified antibodies against the 
      infectivity-enhancing site in uninfected donors, albeit at a lower frequency. These 
      findings demonstrate that not only neutralizing antibodies but also enhancing 
      antibodies are produced during SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - Polyamine synthesis represents one of the most profound metabolic changes during 
      T cell activation, but the biological implications of this are scarcely known. Here, 
      we show that polyamine metabolism is a fundamental process governing the ability of 
      CD4(+) helper T cells (T(H)) to polarize into different functional fates. Deficiency 
      in ornithine decarboxylase, a crucial enzyme for polyamine synthesis, results in a 
      severe failure of CD4(+) T cells to adopt correct subset specification, underscored 
      by ectopic expression of multiple cytokines and lineage-defining transcription 
      factors across T(H) cell subsets. Polyamines control T(H) differentiation by 
      providing substrates for deoxyhypusine synthase, which synthesizes the amino acid 
      hypusine, and mice in which T cells are deficient for hypusine develop severe 
      intestinal inflammatory disease. Polyamine-hypusine deficiency caused widespread 
      epigenetic remodeling driven by alterations in histone acetylation and a re-wired 
      tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Thus, polyamine metabolism is critical for 
      maintaining the epigenome to focus T(H) cell subset fidelity.

AB  - Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infects the majority of the human population and 
      represents the leading viral cause of congenital birth defects. HCMV utilizes the 
      glycoproteins gHgLgO (Trimer) to bind to platelet-derived growth factor receptor 
      alpha (PDGFRα) and transforming growth factor beta receptor 3 (TGFβR3) to gain entry 
      into multiple cell types. This complex is targeted by potent neutralizing antibodies 
      and represents an important candidate for therapeutics against HCMV. Here, we 
      determine three cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of the trimer and 
      the details of its interactions with four binding partners: the receptor proteins 
      PDGFRα and TGFβR3 as well as two broadly neutralizing antibodies. Trimer binding to 
      PDGFRα and TGFβR3 is mutually exclusive, suggesting that they function as 
      independent entry receptors. In addition, Trimer-PDGFRα interaction has an 
      inhibitory effect on PDGFRα signaling. Our results provide a framework for 
      understanding HCMV receptor engagement, neutralization, and the development of 
      anti-viral strategies against HCMV.

AB  - Environmental light cycles entrain circadian feeding behaviors in animals that 
      produce rhythms in exposure to foodborne bacteria. Here, we show that the intestinal 
      microbiota generates diurnal rhythms in innate immunity that synchronize with 
      feeding rhythms to anticipate microbial exposure. Rhythmic expression of 
      antimicrobial proteins was driven by daily rhythms in epithelial attachment by 
      segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), members of the mouse intestinal microbiota. 
      Rhythmic SFB attachment was driven by the circadian clock through control of feeding 
      rhythms. Mechanistically, rhythmic SFB attachment activated an immunological circuit 
      involving group 3 innate lymphoid cells. This circuit triggered oscillations in 
      epithelial STAT3 expression and activation that produced rhythmic antimicrobial 
      protein expression and caused resistance to Salmonella Typhimurium infection to vary 
      across the day-night cycle. Thus, host feeding rhythms synchronize with the 
      microbiota to promote rhythms in intestinal innate immunity that anticipate 
      exogenous microbial exposure.

AB  - Emerging evidence indicates a fundamental role for the epigenome in immunity. Here, 
      we mapped the epigenomic and transcriptional landscape of immunity to influenza 
      vaccination in humans at the single-cell level. Vaccination against seasonal 
      influenza induced persistently diminished H3K27ac in monocytes and myeloid dendritic 
      cells (mDCs), which was associated with impaired cytokine responses to Toll-like 
      receptor stimulation. Single-cell ATAC-seq analysis revealed an epigenomically 
      distinct subcluster of monocytes with reduced chromatin accessibility at 
      AP-1-targeted loci after vaccination. Similar effects were observed in response to 
      vaccination with the AS03-adjuvanted H5N1 pandemic influenza vaccine. However, this 
      vaccine also stimulated persistently increased chromatin accessibility at interferon 
      response factor (IRF) loci in monocytes and mDCs. This was associated with elevated 
      expression of antiviral genes and heightened resistance to the unrelated Zika and 
      Dengue viruses. These results demonstrate that vaccination stimulates persistent 
      epigenomic remodeling of the innate immune system and reveal AS03's potential as an 
      epigenetic adjuvant.

AB  - Genetic recombination generates novel trait combinations, and understanding how 
      recombination is distributed across the genome is key to modern genetics. The PRDM9 
      protein defines recombination hotspots; however, megabase-scale recombination 
      patterning is independent of PRDM9. The single round of DNA replication, which 
      precedes recombination in meiosis, may establish these patterns; therefore, we 
      devised an approach to study meiotic replication that includes robust and sensitive 
      mapping of replication origins. We find that meiotic DNA replication is distinct; 
      reduced origin firing slows replication in meiosis, and a distinctive replication 
      pattern in human males underlies the subtelomeric increase in recombination. We 
      detected a robust correlation between replication and both contemporary and 
      historical recombination and found that replication origin density coupled with 
      chromosome size determines the recombination potential of individual chromosomes. 
      Our findings and methods have implications for understanding the mechanisms 
      underlying DNA replication, genetic recombination, and the landscape of mammalian 
      germline variation.

AB  - The advent of immune checkpoint blockers for cancer therapy has spawned great 
      interest in identifying molecular features reflecting the complexity of tumor 
      immunity, which can subsequently be leveraged as predictive biomarkers. In a 
      thorough big-data approach analyzing the largest series of homogenized molecular and 
      clinical datasets, Litchfield et al. identified a set of genomic biomarkers that 
      identifies immunotherapy responders across cancer types.

AB  - The isocortex and hippocampal formation (HPF) in the mammalian brain play critical 
      roles in perception, cognition, emotion, and learning. We profiled ∼1.3 million 
      cells covering the entire adult mouse isocortex and HPF and derived a transcriptomic 
      cell-type taxonomy revealing a comprehensive repertoire of glutamatergic and 
      GABAergic neuron types. Contrary to the traditional view of HPF as having a simpler 
      cellular organization, we discover a complete set of glutamatergic types in HPF 
      homologous to all major subclasses found in the six-layered isocortex, suggesting 
      that HPF and the isocortex share a common circuit organization. We also identify 
      large-scale continuous and graded variations of cell types along isocortical depth, 
      across the isocortical sheet, and in multiple dimensions in hippocampus and 
      subiculum. Overall, our study establishes a molecular architecture of the mammalian 
      isocortex and hippocampal formation and begins to shed light on its underlying 
      relationship with the development, evolution, connectivity, and function of these 
      two brain structures.

AB  - Foxp3(+) T regulatory (Treg) cells promote immunological tumor tolerance, but how 
      their immune-suppressive function is regulated in the tumor microenvironment (TME) 
      remains unknown. Here, we used intravital microscopy to characterize the cellular 
      interactions that provide tumor-infiltrating Treg cells with critical activation 
      signals. We found that the polyclonal Treg cell repertoire is pre-enriched to 
      recognize antigens presented by tumor-associated conventional dendritic cells 
      (cDCs). Unstable cDC contacts sufficed to sustain Treg cell function, whereas T 
      helper cells were activated during stable interactions. Contact instability resulted 
      from CTLA-4-dependent downregulation of co-stimulatory B7-family proteins on cDCs, 
      mediated by Treg cells themselves. CTLA-4-blockade triggered CD28-dependent Treg 
      cell hyper-proliferation in the TME, and concomitant Treg cell inactivation was 
      required to achieve tumor rejection. Therefore, Treg cells self-regulate through a 
      CTLA-4- and CD28-dependent feedback loop that adjusts their population size to the 
      amount of local co-stimulation. Its disruption through CTLA-4-blockade may off-set 
      therapeutic benefits in cancer patients.

AB  - Selfish centromere DNA sequences bias their transmission to the egg in female 
      meiosis. Evolutionary theory suggests that centromere proteins evolve to suppress 
      costs of this "centromere drive." In hybrid mouse models with genetically different 
      maternal and paternal centromeres, selfish centromere DNA exploits a kinetochore 
      pathway to recruit microtubule-destabilizing proteins that act as drive effectors. 
      We show that such functional differences are suppressed by a parallel pathway for 
      effector recruitment by heterochromatin, which is similar between centromeres in 
      this system. Disrupting the kinetochore pathway with a divergent allele of CENP-C 
      reduces functional differences between centromeres, whereas disrupting 
      heterochromatin by CENP-B deletion amplifies the differences. Molecular evolution 
      analyses using Murinae genomes identify adaptive evolution in proteins in both 
      pathways. We propose that centromere proteins have recurrently evolved to minimize 
      the kinetochore pathway, which is exploited by selfish DNA, relative to the 
      heterochromatin pathway that equalizes centromeres, while maintaining essential 
      functions.

AB  - Emerging evidence supports that mitochondrial dysfunction contributes to systemic 
      lupus erythematosus (SLE) pathogenesis. Here we show that programmed mitochondrial 
      removal, a hallmark of mammalian erythropoiesis, is defective in SLE. Specifically, 
      we demonstrate that during human erythroid cell maturation, a hypoxia-inducible 
      factor (HIF)-mediated metabolic switch is responsible for the activation of the 
      ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), which precedes and is necessary for the 
      autophagic removal of mitochondria. A defect in this pathway leads to accumulation 
      of red blood cells (RBCs) carrying mitochondria (Mito(+) RBCs) in SLE patients and 
      in correlation with disease activity. Antibody-mediated internalization of Mito(+) 
      RBCs induces type I interferon (IFN) production through activation of cGAS in 
      macrophages. Accordingly, SLE patients carrying both Mito(+) RBCs and opsonizing 
      antibodies display the highest levels of blood IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) signatures, 
      a distinctive feature of SLE.

AB  - Many organisms evolved strategies to survive desiccation. Plant seeds protect 
      dehydrated embryos from various stressors and can lay dormant for millennia. 
      Hydration is the key trigger to initiate germination, but the mechanism by which 
      seeds sense water remains unresolved. We identified an uncharacterized Arabidopsis 
      thaliana prion-like protein we named FLOE1, which phase separates upon hydration and 
      allows the embryo to sense water stress. We demonstrate that biophysical states of 
      FLOE1 condensates modulate its biological function in vivo in suppressing seed 
      germination under unfavorable environments. We find intragenic, intraspecific, and 
      interspecific natural variation in FLOE1 expression and phase separation and show 
      that intragenic variation is associated with adaptive germination strategies in 
      natural populations. This combination of molecular, organismal, and ecological 
      studies uncovers FLOE1 as a tunable environmental sensor with direct implications 
      for the design of drought-resistant crops, in the face of climate change.

TI  - The interferon landscape along the respiratory tract impacts the severity of 
      COVID-19.
LID - S0092-8674(21)00990-9 [pii]

AB  - Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by overproduction of 
      immune mediators, but the role of interferons (IFNs) of the type I (IFN-I) or type 
      III (IFN-III) families remains debated. We scrutinized the production of IFNs along 
      the respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients and found that high levels of IFN-III, 
      and to a lesser extent IFN-I, characterize the upper airways of patients with high 
      viral burden but reduced disease risk or severity. Production of specific IFN-III, 
      but not IFN-I, members denotes patients with a mild pathology and efficiently drives 
      the transcription of genes that protect against severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In contrast, compared to subjects with other infectious 
      or noninfectious lung pathologies, IFNs are overrepresented in the lower airways of 
      patients with severe COVID-19 that exhibit gene pathways associated with increased 
      apoptosis and decreased proliferation. Our data demonstrate a dynamic production of 
      IFNs in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients and show IFNs play opposing roles at distinct 
      anatomical sites.

AB  - Elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of human brain evolution is essential to 
      understanding human cognition and mental disorders. We generated multi-omics 
      profiles and constructed a high-resolution map of 3D genome architecture of rhesus 
      macaque during corticogenesis. By comparing the 3D genomes of human, macaque, and 
      mouse brains, we identified many human-specific chromatin structure changes, 
      including 499 topologically associating domains (TADs) and 1,266 chromatin loops. 
      The human-specific loops are significantly enriched in enhancer-enhancer 
      interactions, and the regulated genes show human-specific expression changes in the 
      subplate, a transient zone of the developing brain critical for neural circuit 
      formation and plasticity. Notably, many human-specific sequence changes are located 
      in the human-specific TAD boundaries and loop anchors, which may generate new 
      transcription factor binding sites and chromatin structures in human. Collectively, 
      the presented data highlight the value of comparative 3D genome analyses in 
      dissecting the regulatory mechanisms of brain development and evolution.

      (A1114G; T372A) within the spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD), predicted to 
      remove glycosylation and increase binding to human ACE2 (hACE2), the cellular 
      receptor. This change is present in all human SARS-CoV-2 sequences but not in 
      closely related viruses from bats and pangolins. As predicted, T372A RBD bound hACE2 
      with higher affinity in experimental binding assays. We engineered the reversion 
      mutant (A372T) and found that A372 (wild-type [WT]-SARS-CoV-2) enhanced replication 
      in human lung cells relative to its putative ancestral variant (T372), an effect 
      that was 20 times greater than the well-known D614G mutation. Our findings suggest 
      that this mutation likely contributed to SARS-CoV-2 emergence from animal reservoirs 
      or enabled sustained human-to-human transmission.

AB  - Only five species of the once-diverse Rhinocerotidae remain, making the 
      reconstruction of their evolutionary history a challenge to biologists since Darwin. 
      We sequenced genomes from five rhinoceros species (three extinct and two living), 
      which we compared to existing data from the remaining three living species and a 
      range of outgroups. We identify an early divergence between extant African and 
      Eurasian lineages, resolving a key debate regarding the phylogeny of extant 
      rhinoceroses. This early Miocene (∼16 million years ago [mya]) split post-dates the 
      land bridge formation between the Afro-Arabian and Eurasian landmasses. Our analyses 
      also show that while rhinoceros genomes in general exhibit low levels of genome-wide 
      diversity, heterozygosity is lowest and inbreeding is highest in the modern species. 
      These results suggest that while low genetic diversity is a long-term feature of the 
      family, it has been particularly exacerbated recently, likely reflecting recent 
      anthropogenic-driven population declines.

AB  - Ahmed and colleagues recently described a novel hybrid lymphocyte expressing both a 
      B and T cell receptor, termed double expresser (DE) cells. DE cells in blood of type 
      1 diabetes (T1D) subjects were present at increased numbers and enriched for a 
      public B cell clonotype. Here, we attempted to reproduce these findings. While we 
      could identify DE cells by flow cytometry, we found no association between DE cell 
      frequency and T1D status. We were unable to identify the reported public B cell 
      clone, or any similar clone, in bulk B cells or sorted DE cells from T1D subjects or 
      controls. We also did not observe increased usage of the public clone VH or DH genes 
      in B cells or in sorted DE cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that DE cells 
      and their alleged public clonotype are not enriched in T1D. This Matters Arising 
      paper is in response to Ahmed et al. (2019), published in Cell. See also the 
      response by Ahmed et al. (2021), published in this issue.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread 
      within the human population. Although SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus, most humans 
      had been previously exposed to other antigenically distinct common seasonal human 
      coronaviruses (hCoVs) before the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Here, 
      we quantified levels of SARS-CoV-2-reactive antibodies and hCoV-reactive antibodies 
      in serum samples collected from 431 humans before the COVID-19 pandemic. We then 
      quantified pre-pandemic antibody levels in serum from a separate cohort of 251 
      individuals who became PCR-confirmed infected with SARS-CoV-2. Finally, we 
      longitudinally measured hCoV and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the serum of hospitalized 
      COVID-19 patients. Our studies indicate that most individuals possessed 
      hCoV-reactive antibodies before the COVID-19 pandemic. We determined that ∼20% of 
      these individuals possessed non-neutralizing antibodies that cross-reacted with 
      SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins. These antibodies were not associated 
      with protection against SARS-CoV-2 infections or hospitalizations, but they were 
      boosted upon SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - During cell migration or differentiation, cell surface receptors are simultaneously 
      exposed to different ligands. However, it is often unclear how these extracellular 
      signals are integrated. Neogenin (NEO1) acts as an attractive guidance receptor when 
      the Netrin-1 (NET1) ligand binds, but it mediates repulsion via repulsive guidance 
      molecule (RGM) ligands. Here, we show that signal integration occurs through the 
      formation of a ternary NEO1-NET1-RGM complex, which triggers reciprocal silencing of 
      downstream signaling. Our NEO1-NET1-RGM structures reveal a "trimer-of-trimers" 
      super-assembly, which exists in the cell membrane. Super-assembly formation results 
      in inhibition of RGMA-NEO1-mediated growth cone collapse and RGMA- or 
      NET1-NEO1-mediated neuron migration, by preventing formation of signaling-compatible 
      RGM-NEO1 complexes and NET1-induced NEO1 ectodomain clustering. These results 
      illustrate how simultaneous binding of ligands with opposing functions, to a single 
      receptor, does not lead to competition for binding, but to formation of a 
      super-complex that diminishes their functional outputs.

AB  - The N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) RNA modification is used widely to alter the fate 
      of mRNAs. Here we demonstrate that the C. elegans writer METT-10 (the ortholog of 
      mouse METTL16) deposits an m(6)A mark on the 3' splice site (AG) of the 
      S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) synthetase pre-mRNA, which inhibits its proper splicing 
      and protein production. The mechanism is triggered by a rich diet and acts as an 
      m(6)A-mediated switch to stop SAM production and regulate its homeostasis. Although 
      the mammalian SAM synthetase pre-mRNA is not regulated via this mechanism, we show 
      that splicing inhibition by 3' splice site m(6)A is conserved in mammals. The 
      modification functions by physically preventing the essential splicing factor U2AF35 
      from recognizing the 3' splice site. We propose that use of splice-site m(6)A is an 
      ancient mechanism for splicing regulation.

AB  - Divergence of gene function is a hallmark of evolution, but assessing functional 
      divergence over deep time is not trivial. The few alleles available for 
      cross-species studies often fail to expose the entire functional spectrum of genes, 
      potentially obscuring deeply conserved pleiotropic roles. Here, we explore the 
      functional divergence of WUSCHEL HOMEOBOX9 (WOX9), suggested to have 
      species-specific roles in embryo and inflorescence development. Using a 
      cis-regulatory editing drive system, we generate a comprehensive allelic series in 
      tomato, which revealed hidden pleiotropic roles for WOX9. Analysis of accessible 
      chromatin and conserved cis-regulatory sequences identifies the regions responsible 
      for this pleiotropic activity, the functions of which are conserved in groundcherry, 
      a tomato relative. Mimicking these alleles in Arabidopsis, distantly related to 
      tomato and groundcherry, reveals new inflorescence phenotypes, exposing a deeply 
      conserved pleiotropy. We suggest that targeted cis-regulatory mutations can uncover 
      conserved gene functions and reduce undesirable effects in crop improvement.

AB  - Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an aggressive brain tumor for which current 
      immunotherapy approaches have been unsuccessful. Here, we explore the mechanisms 
      underlying immune evasion in GBM. By serially transplanting GBM stem cells (GSCs) 
      into immunocompetent hosts, we uncover an acquired capability of GSCs to escape 
      immune clearance by establishing an enhanced immunosuppressive tumor 
      microenvironment. Mechanistically, this is not elicited via genetic selection of 
      tumor subclones, but through an epigenetic immunoediting process wherein stable 
      transcriptional and epigenetic changes in GSCs are enforced following immune attack. 
      These changes launch a myeloid-affiliated transcriptional program, which leads to 
      increased recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages. Furthermore, we identify 
      similar epigenetic and transcriptional signatures in human mesenchymal subtype GSCs. 
      We conclude that epigenetic immunoediting may drive an acquired immune evasion 
      program in the most aggressive mesenchymal GBM subtype by reshaping the tumor immune 
      microenvironment.

AB  - Nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs) are major immune receptors 
      in plants and animals. Upon activation, the Arabidopsis NLR protein ZAR1 forms a 
      pentameric resistosome in vitro and triggers immune responses and cell death in 
      plants. In this study, we employed single-molecule imaging to show that the 
      activated ZAR1 protein can form pentameric complexes in the plasma membrane. The 
      ZAR1 resistosome displayed ion channel activity in Xenopus oocytes in a manner 
      dependent on a conserved acidic residue Glu11 situated in the channel pore. 
      Pre-assembled ZAR1 resistosome was readily incorporated into planar lipid-bilayers 
      and displayed calcium-permeable cation-selective channel activity. Furthermore, we 
      show that activation of ZAR1 in the plant cell led to Glu11-dependent Ca(2+) influx, 
      perturbation of subcellular structures, production of reactive oxygen species, and 
      cell death. The results thus support that the ZAR1 resistosome acts as a

AB  - The race to produce vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2) began when the first sequence was published, and this forms the basis 
      for vaccines currently deployed globally. Independent lineages of SARS-CoV-2 have 
      recently been reported: UK, B.1.1.7; South Africa, B.1.351; and Brazil, P.1. These 
      variants have multiple changes in the immunodominant spike protein that facilitates 
      viral cell entry via the angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor. Mutations 
      in the receptor recognition site on the spike are of great concern for their 
      potential for immune escape. Here, we describe a structure-function analysis of 
      B.1.351 using a large cohort of convalescent and vaccinee serum samples. The 
      receptor-binding domain mutations provide tighter ACE2 binding and widespread escape 
      from monoclonal antibody neutralization largely driven by E484K, although K417N and 
      N501Y act together against some important antibody classes. In a number of cases, it 
      would appear that convalescent and some vaccine serum offers limited protection 
      against this variant.

AB  - We identified an emerging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2) variant by viral whole-genome sequencing of 2,172 nasal/nasopharyngeal 
      swab samples from 44 counties in California, a state in the western United States. 
      Named B.1.427/B.1.429 to denote its two lineages, the variant emerged in May 2020 
      and increased from 0% to >50% of sequenced cases from September 2020 to January 
      2021, showing 18.6%-24% increased transmissibility relative to wild-type circulating 
      strains. The variant carries three mutations in the spike protein, including an 
      L452R substitution. We found 2-fold increased B.1.427/B.1.429 viral shedding in vivo 
      and increased L452R pseudovirus infection of cell cultures and lung organoids, 
      albeit decreased relative to pseudoviruses carrying the N501Y mutation common to 
      variants B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1. Antibody neutralization assays revealed 4.0- to 
      6.7-fold and 2.0-fold decreases in neutralizing titers from convalescent patients 
      and vaccine recipients, respectively. The increased prevalence of a more 
      transmissible variant in California exhibiting decreased antibody neutralization 
      warrants further investigation.

AB  - Northern East Asia was inhabited by modern humans as early as 40 thousand years ago 
      (ka), as demonstrated by the Tianyuan individual. Using genome-wide data obtained 
      from 25 individuals dated to 33.6-3.4 ka from the Amur region, we show that 
      Tianyuan-related ancestry was widespread in northern East Asia before the Last 
      Glacial Maximum (LGM). At the close of the LGM stadial, the earliest northern East 
      Asian appeared in the Amur region, and this population is basal to ancient northern 
      East Asians. Human populations in the Amur region have maintained genetic continuity 
      from 14 ka, and these early inhabitants represent the closest East Asian source 
      known for Ancient Paleo-Siberians. We also observed that EDAR V370A was likely to 
      have been elevated to high frequency after the LGM, suggesting the possible timing 
      for its selection. This study provides a deep look into the population dynamics of 
      northern East Asia.

AB  - Engineering new functionality into living eukaryotic systems by enzyme evolution or 
      de novo protein design is a formidable challenge. Cells do not rely exclusively on 
      DNA-based evolution to generate new functionality but often utilize membrane 
      encapsulation or formation of membraneless organelles to separate distinct molecular 
      processes that execute complex operations. Applying this principle and the concept 
      of two-dimensional phase separation, we develop film-like synthetic organelles that 
      support protein translation on the surfaces of various cellular membranes. These 
      sub-resolution synthetic films provide a path to make functionally distinct enzymes 
      within the same cell. We use these film-like organelles to equip eukaryotic cells 
      with dual orthogonal expanded genetic codes that enable the specific reprogramming 
      of distinct translational machineries with single-residue precision. The ability to 
      spatially tune the output of translation within tens of nanometers is not only 
      important for synthetic biology but has implications for understanding the function 
      of membrane-associated protein condensation in cells.

AB  - COVID-19 exhibits extensive patient-to-patient heterogeneity. To link immune 
      response variation to disease severity and outcome over time, we longitudinally 
      assessed circulating proteins as well as 188 surface protein markers, transcriptome, 
      and T cell receptor sequence simultaneously in single peripheral immune cells from 
      COVID-19 patients. Conditional-independence network analysis revealed primary 
      correlates of disease severity, including gene expression signatures of apoptosis in 
      plasmacytoid dendritic cells and attenuated inflammation but increased fatty acid 
      metabolism in CD56(dim)CD16(hi) NK cells linked positively to circulating 
      interleukin (IL)-15. CD8(+) T cell activation was apparent without signs of 
      exhaustion. Although cellular inflammation was depressed in severe patients early 
      after hospitalization, it became elevated by days 17-23 post symptom onset, 
      suggestive of a late wave of inflammatory responses. Furthermore, circulating 
      protein trajectories at this time were divergent between and predictive of recovery

AB  - Cognitive flexibility, the ability to alter strategy according to changing 
      stimulus-response-reward relationships, is critical for updating learned behavior. 
      Attentional set-shifting, a test of cognitive flexibility, depends on the activity 
      of prefrontal cortex (PFC). It remains unclear, however, what role PFC neurons play 
      to support set-shifting. Using optogenetics and two-photon calcium imaging, we 
      demonstrate that medial PFC activity does not bias sensorimotor responses during 
      set-shifting, but rather enables set-shifting by encoding trial feedback 
      information, a role it has been known to play in other contexts. Unexpectedly, the 
      functional properties of PFC cells did not vary with their efferent projection 
      targets. Instead, representations of trial feedback formed a topological gradient, 
      with cells more strongly selective for feedback information located further from the 
      pial surface, where afferent input from the anterior cingulate cortex was denser. 
      These findings identify a critical role for deep PFC projection neurons in enabling 
      set-shifting through behavioral feedback monitoring.

AB  - Cellular versatility depends on accurate trafficking of diverse proteins to their 
      organellar destinations. For the secretory pathway (followed by approximately 30% of 
      all proteins), the physical nature of the vessel conducting the first portage 
      (endoplasmic reticulum [ER] to Golgi apparatus) is unclear. We provide a dynamic 3D 
      view of early secretory compartments in mammalian cells with isotropic resolution 
      and precise protein localization using whole-cell, focused ion beam scanning 
      electron microscopy with cryo-structured illumination microscopy and live-cell 
      synchronized cargo release approaches. Rather than vesicles alone, the ER spawns an 
      elaborate, interwoven tubular network of contiguous lipid bilayers (ER exit site) 
      for protein export. This receptacle is capable of extending microns along 
      microtubules while still connected to the ER by a thin neck. COPII localizes to this 
      neck region and dynamically regulates cargo entry from the ER, while COPI acts more 
      distally, escorting the detached, accelerating tubular entity on its way to joining 
      the Golgi apparatus through microtubule-directed movement.

AB  - The bacterial flagellar motor is a supramolecular protein machine that drives 
      rotation of the flagellum for motility, which is essential for bacterial survival in 
      different environments and a key determinant of pathogenicity. The detailed 
      structure of the flagellar motor remains unknown. Here we present an 
      atomic-resolution cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the bacterial 
      flagellar motor complexed with the hook, consisting of 175 subunits with a molecular 
      mass of approximately 6.3 MDa. The structure reveals that 10 peptides protruding 
      from the MS ring with the FlgB and FliE subunits mediate torque transmission from 
      the MS ring to the rod and overcome the symmetry mismatch between the rotational and 
      helical structures in the motor. The LP ring contacts the distal rod and applies 
      electrostatic forces to support its rotation and torque transmission to the hook. 
      This work provides detailed molecular insights into the structure, assembly, and 
      torque transmission mechanisms of the flagellar motor.

AB  - By following up the gut microbiome, 51 human phenotypes and plasma levels of 1,183 
      metabolites in 338 individuals after 4 years, we characterize microbial stability 
      and variation in relation to host physiology. Using these individual-specific and 
      temporally stable microbial profiles, including bacterial SNPs and structural 
      variations, we develop a microbial fingerprinting method that shows up to 85% 
      accuracy in classifying metagenomic samples taken 4 years apart. Application of our 
      fingerprinting method to the independent HMP cohort results in 95% accuracy for 
      samples taken 1 year apart. We further observe temporal changes in the abundance of 
      multiple bacterial species, metabolic pathways, and structural variation, as well as 
      strain replacement. We report 190 longitudinal microbial associations with host 
      phenotypes and 519 associations with plasma metabolites. These associations are 
      enriched for cardiometabolic traits, vitamin B, and uremic toxins. Finally, 
      mediation analysis suggests that the gut microbiome may influence cardiometabolic 
      health through its metabolites.

AB  - Membrane remodeling and repair are essential for all cells. Proteins that perform 
      these functions include Vipp1/IM30 in photosynthetic plastids, PspA in bacteria, and 
      ESCRT-III in eukaryotes. Here, using a combination of evolutionary and structural 
      analyses, we show that these protein families are homologous and share a common 
      ancient evolutionary origin that likely predates the last universal common ancestor. 
      This homology is evident in cryo-electron microscopy structures of Vipp1 rings from 
      the cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme presented over a range of symmetries. Each 
      ring is assembled from rungs that stack and progressively tilt to form dome-shaped 
      curvature. Assembly is facilitated by hinges in the Vipp1 monomer, similar to those 
      in ESCRT-III proteins, which allow the formation of flexible polymers. Rings have an 
      inner lumen that is able to bind and deform membranes. Collectively, these data 
      suggest conserved mechanistic principles that underlie Vipp1, PspA, and 
      ESCRT-III-dependent membrane remodeling across all domains of life.

AB  - To control viral infection, vertebrates rely on both inducible interferon responses 
      and less well-characterized cell-intrinsic responses composed of "at the ready" 
      antiviral effector proteins. Here, we show that E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM7 is a 
      cell-intrinsic antiviral effector that restricts multiple human enteroviruses by 
      targeting viral 2BC, a membrane remodeling protein, for ubiquitination and 
      proteasome-dependent degradation. Selective pressure exerted by TRIM7 results in 
      emergence of a TRIM7-resistant coxsackievirus with a single point mutation in the 
      viral 2C ATPase/helicase. In cultured cells, the mutation helps the virus evade 
      TRIM7 but impairs optimal viral replication, and this correlates with a hyperactive 
      and structurally plastic 2C ATPase. Unexpectedly, the TRIM7-resistant virus has a 
      replication advantage in mice and causes lethal pancreatitis. These findings reveal 
      a unique mechanism for targeting enterovirus replication and provide molecular 
      insight into the benefits and trade-offs of viral evolution imposed by a host 
      restriction factor.

AB  - Genetic perturbations of cortical development can lead to neurodevelopmental 
      disease, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To identify genomic regions 
      crucial to corticogenesis, we mapped the activity of gene-regulatory elements 
      generating a single-cell atlas of gene expression and chromatin accessibility both 
      independently and jointly. This revealed waves of gene regulation by key 
      transcription factors (TFs) across a nearly continuous differentiation trajectory, 
      distinguished the expression programs of glial lineages, and identified 
      lineage-determining TFs that exhibited strong correlation between linked 
      gene-regulatory elements and expression levels. These highly connected genes adopted 
      an active chromatin state in early differentiating cells, consistent with lineage 
      commitment. Base-pair-resolution neural network models identified strong 
      cell-type-specific enrichment of noncoding mutations predicted to be disruptive in a 
      cohort of ASD individuals and identified frequently disrupted TF binding sites. This 
      approach illustrates how cell-type-specific mapping can provide insights into the 
      programs governing human development and disease.

AB  - The impact of the microbiome on HIV disease is widely acknowledged although the 
      mechanisms downstream of fluctuations in microbial composition remain speculative. 
      We detected rapid, dynamic changes in translocated microbial constituents during two 
      years after cART initiation. An unbiased systems biology approach revealed two 
      distinct pathways driven by changes in the abundance ratio of Serratia to other 
      bacterial genera. Increased CD4 T cell numbers over the first year were associated 
      with high Serratia abundance, pro-inflammatory innate cytokines, and metabolites 
      that drive Th17 gene expression signatures and restoration of mucosal integrity. 
      Subsequently, decreased Serratia abundance and downregulation of innate cytokines 
      allowed re-establishment of systemic T cell homeostasis promoting restoration of Th1 
      and Th2 gene expression signatures. Analyses of three other geographically distinct 
      cohorts of treated HIV infection established a more generalized principle that 
      changes in diversity and composition of translocated microbial species influence 
      systemic inflammation and consequently CD4 T cell recovery.

AB  - Gene expression by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) is tightly controlled by 
      cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) at discrete checkpoints during the transcription 
      cycle. The pausing checkpoint following transcription initiation is primarily 
      controlled by CDK9. We discovered that CDK9-mediated, RNAPII-driven transcription is 
      functionally opposed by a protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complex that is recruited to 
      transcription sites by the Integrator complex subunit INTS6. PP2A dynamically 
      antagonizes phosphorylation of key CDK9 substrates including DSIF and RNAPII-CTD. 
      Loss of INTS6 results in resistance to tumor cell death mediated by CDK9 inhibition, 
      decreased turnover of CDK9 phospho-substrates, and amplification of acute oncogenic 
      transcriptional responses. Pharmacological PP2A activation synergizes with CDK9 
      inhibition to kill both leukemic and solid tumor cells, providing therapeutic 
      benefit in vivo. These data demonstrate that fine control of gene expression relies 
      on the balance between kinase and phosphatase activity throughout the transcription 
      cycle, a process dysregulated in cancer that can be exploited therapeutically.

AB  - Vesicle-inducing protein in plastids 1 (VIPP1) is essential for the biogenesis and 
      maintenance of thylakoid membranes, which transform light into life. However, it is 
      unknown how VIPP1 performs its vital membrane-remodeling functions. Here, we use 
      cryo-electron microscopy to determine structures of cyanobacterial VIPP1 rings, 
      revealing how VIPP1 monomers flex and interweave to form basket-like assemblies of 
      different symmetries. Three VIPP1 monomers together coordinate a non-canonical 
      nucleotide binding pocket on one end of the ring. Inside the ring's lumen, 
      amphipathic helices from each monomer align to form large hydrophobic columns, 
      enabling VIPP1 to bind and curve membranes. In vivo mutations in these hydrophobic 
      surfaces cause extreme thylakoid swelling under high light, indicating an essential 
      role of VIPP1 lipid binding in resisting stress-induced damage. Using 
      cryo-correlative light and electron microscopy (cryo-CLEM), we observe oligomeric 
      VIPP1 coats encapsulating membrane tubules within the Chlamydomonas chloroplast. Our 
      work provides a structural foundation for understanding how VIPP1 directs thylakoid 
      biogenesis and maintenance.

AB  - Group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) regulate immunity and inflammation, yet their 
      role in cancer remains elusive. Here, we identify that colorectal cancer (CRC) 
      manifests with altered ILC3s that are characterized by reduced frequencies, 
      increased plasticity, and an imbalance with T cells. We evaluated the consequences 
      of these changes in mice and determined that a dialog between ILC3s and T cells via 
      major histocompatibility complex class II (MHCII) is necessary to support 
      colonization with microbiota that subsequently induce type-1 immunity in the 
      intestine and tumor microenvironment. As a result, mice lacking ILC3-specific MHCII 
      develop invasive CRC and resistance to anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Finally, humans with 
      dysregulated intestinal ILC3s harbor microbiota that fail to induce type-1 immunity 
      and immunotherapy responsiveness when transferred to mice. Collectively, these data 
      define a protective role for ILC3s in cancer and indicate that their inherent 
      disruption in CRC drives dysfunctional adaptive immunity, tumor progression, and 
      immunotherapy resistance.

AB  - G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent a ubiquitous membrane protein family 
      and are important drug targets. Their diverse signaling pathways are driven by 
      complex pharmacology arising from a conformational ensemble rarely captured by 
      structural methods. Here, fluorine nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((19)F 
      NMR) is used to delineate key functional states of the adenosine A(2A) receptor 
      (A(2A)R) complexed with heterotrimeric G protein (Gα(s)β(1)γ(2)) in a phospholipid 
      membrane milieu. Analysis of A(2A)R spectra as a function of ligand, G protein, and 
      nucleotide identifies an ensemble represented by inactive states, a G-protein-bound 
      activation intermediate, and distinct nucleotide-free states associated with either 
      partial- or full-agonist-driven activation. The Gβγ subunit is found to be critical 
      in facilitating ligand-dependent allosteric transmission, as shown by (19)F NMR, 
      biochemical, and computational studies. The results provide a mechanistic basis for 
      understanding basal signaling, efficacy, precoupling, and allostery in GPCRs.

AB  - Glycans modify lipids and proteins to mediate inter- and intramolecular interactions 
      across all domains of life. RNA is not thought to be a major target of 
      glycosylation. Here, we challenge this view with evidence that mammals use RNA as a 
      third scaffold for glycosylation. Using a battery of chemical and biochemical 
      approaches, we found that conserved small noncoding RNAs bear sialylated glycans. 
      These "glycoRNAs" were present in multiple cell types and mammalian species, in 
      cultured cells, and in vivo. GlycoRNA assembly depends on canonical N-glycan 
      biosynthetic machinery and results in structures enriched in sialic acid and fucose. 
      Analysis of living cells revealed that the majority of glycoRNAs were present on the 
      cell surface and can interact with anti-dsRNA antibodies and members of the Siglec 
      receptor family. Collectively, these findings suggest the existence of a direct 
      interface between RNA biology and glycobiology, and an expanded role for RNA in 
      extracellular biology.

AB  - In this study we profiled vaccine-induced polyclonal antibodies as well as 
      plasmablast-derived mAbs from individuals who received SARS-CoV-2 spike mRNA 
      vaccine. Polyclonal antibody responses in vaccinees were robust and comparable to or 
      exceeded those seen after natural infection. However, the ratio of binding to 
      neutralizing antibodies after vaccination was greater than that after natural 
      infection and, at the monoclonal level, we found that the majority of 
      vaccine-induced antibodies did not have neutralizing activity. We also found a 
      co-dominance of mAbs targeting the NTD and RBD of SARS-CoV-2 spike and an original 
      antigenic-sin like backboost to spikes of seasonal human coronaviruses OC43 and 
      HKU1. Neutralizing activity of NTD mAbs but not RBD mAbs against a clinical viral 
      isolate carrying E484K as well as extensive changes in the NTD was abolished, 
      suggesting that a proportion of vaccine-induced RBD binding antibodies may provide 
      substantial protection against viral variants carrying single E484K RBD mutations.

AB  - The capping of mRNA and the proofreading play essential roles in SARS-CoV-2 
      replication and transcription. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of the 
      SARS-CoV-2 replication-transcription complex (RTC) in a form identified as 
      Cap(0)-RTC, which couples a co-transcriptional capping complex (CCC) composed of 
      nsp12 NiRAN, nsp9, the bifunctional nsp14 possessing an N-terminal exoribonuclease 
      (ExoN) and a C-terminal N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase), and nsp10 as a cofactor of 
      nsp14. Nsp9 and nsp12 NiRAN recruit nsp10/nsp14 into the Cap(0)-RTC, forming the 
      N7-CCC to yield cap(0) ((7Me)GpppA) at 5' end of pre-mRNA. A dimeric form of 
      Cap(0)-RTC observed by cryo-EM suggests an in trans backtracking mechanism for nsp14 
      ExoN to facilitate proofreading of the RNA in concert with polymerase nsp12. These 
      results not only provide a structural basis for understanding co-transcriptional 
      modification of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA but also shed light on how replication fidelity in 
      SARS-CoV-2 is maintained.

TI  - Human gut mycobiota tune immunity via CARD9-dependent induction of anti-fungal IgG 
      antibodies.

AB  - Antibodies mediate natural and vaccine-induced immunity against viral and bacterial 
      pathogens, whereas fungi represent a widespread kingdom of pathogenic species for 
      which neither vaccine nor neutralizing antibody therapies are clinically available. 
      Here, using a multi-kingdom antibody profiling (multiKAP) approach, we explore the 
      human antibody repertoires against gut commensal fungi (mycobiota). We identify 
      species preferentially targeted by systemic antibodies in humans, with Candida 
      albicans being the major inducer of antifungal immunoglobulin G (IgG). Fungal 
      colonization of the gut induces germinal center (GC)-dependent B cell expansion in 
      extraintestinal lymphoid tissues and generates systemic antibodies that confer 
      protection against disseminated C. albicans or C. auris infection. Antifungal IgG 
      production depends on the innate immunity regulator CARD9 and CARD9(+)CX3CR1(+) 
      macrophages. In individuals with invasive candidiasis, loss-of-function mutations in 
      CARD9 are associated with impaired antifungal IgG responses. These results reveal an 
      important role of gut commensal fungi in shaping the human antibody repertoire 
      through CARD9-dependent induction of host-protective antifungal IgG.

AB  - Transcription initiation requires assembly of the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) 
      pre-initiation complex (PIC) and opening of promoter DNA. Here, we present the 
      long-sought high-resolution structure of the yeast PIC and define the mechanism of 
      initial DNA opening. We trap the PIC in an intermediate state that contains half a 
      turn of open DNA located 30-35 base pairs downstream of the TATA box. The initially 
      opened DNA region is flanked and stabilized by the polymerase "clamp head loop" and 
      the TFIIF "charged region" that both contribute to promoter-initiated transcription. 
      TFIIE facilitates initiation by buttressing the clamp head loop and by regulating 
      the TFIIH translocase. The initial DNA bubble is then extended in the upstream 
      direction, leading to the open promoter complex and enabling start-site scanning and 
      RNA synthesis. This unique mechanism of DNA opening may permit more intricate 
      regulation than in the Pol I and Pol III systems.

AB  - Animals face both external and internal dangers: pathogens threaten from the 
      environment, and unstable genomic elements threaten from within. C. elegans protects 
      itself from pathogens by "reading" bacterial small RNAs, using this information to 
      both induce avoidance and transmit memories for four generations. Here, we found 
      that memories can be transferred from either lysed animals or from conditioned media 
      to naive animals via Cer1 retrotransposon-encoded virus-like particles. Moreover, 
      Cer1 functions internally at the step of transmission of information from the 
      germline to neurons and is required for learned avoidance. The presence of the Cer1 
      retrotransposon in wild C. elegans strains correlates with the ability to learn and 
      inherit small-RNA-induced pathogen avoidance. Together, these results suggest that 
      C. elegans has co-opted a potentially dangerous retrotransposon to instead protect 
      itself and its progeny from a common pathogen through its inter-tissue signaling 
      ability, hijacking this genomic element for its own adaptive immunity benefit.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein contains an immunodominant receptor-binding 
      domain (RBD) targeted by most neutralizing antibodies (Abs) in COVID-19 patient 
      plasma. Little is known about neutralizing Abs binding to epitopes outside the RBD 
      and their contribution to protection. Here, we describe 41 human monoclonal Abs 
      (mAbs) derived from memory B cells, which recognize the SARS-CoV-2 S N-terminal 
      domain (NTD) and show that a subset of them neutralize SARS-CoV-2 ultrapotently. We 
      define an antigenic map of the SARS-CoV-2 NTD and identify a supersite (designated 
      site i) recognized by all known NTD-specific neutralizing mAbs. These mAbs inhibit 
      cell-to-cell fusion, activate effector functions, and protect Syrian hamsters from 
      SARS-CoV-2 challenge, albeit selecting escape mutants in some animals. Indeed, 
      several SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and P.1 lineages, 
      harbor frequent mutations within the NTD supersite, suggesting ongoing selective 
      pressure and the importance of NTD-specific neutralizing mAbs for protective 
      immunity and vaccine design.

      female cells in early development and thereafter is thought to be largely 
      dispensable. Here, we show XIST is continually required in adult human B cells to 
      silence a subset of X-linked immune genes such as TLR7. XIST-dependent genes lack 
      promoter DNA methylation and require continual XIST-dependent histone deacetylation. 
      XIST RNA-directed proteomics and CRISPRi screen reveal distinctive somatic 
      cell-type-specific XIST complexes and identify TRIM28 that mediates Pol II pausing 
      at promoters of X-linked genes in B cells. Single-cell transcriptome data of female 
      patients with either systemic lupus erythematosus or COVID-19 infection revealed 
      XIST dysregulation, reflected by escape of XIST-dependent genes, in CD11c(+) 
      atypical memory B cells (ABCs). XIST inactivation with TLR7 agonism suffices to 
      promote isotype-switched ABCs. These results indicate cell-type-specific 
      diversification and function for lncRNA-protein complexes and suggest expanded roles 
      for XIST in sex-differences in biology and medicine.

AB  - Structural variations (SVs) and gene copy number variations (gCNVs) have contributed 
      to crop evolution, domestication, and improvement. Here, we assembled 31 
      high-quality genomes of genetically diverse rice accessions. Coupling with two 
      existing assemblies, we developed pan-genome-scale genomic resources including a 
      graph-based genome, providing access to rice genomic variations. Specifically, we 
      discovered 171,072 SVs and 25,549 gCNVs and used an Oryza glaberrima assembly to 
      infer the derived states of SVs in the Oryza sativa population. Our analyses of SV 
      formation mechanisms, impacts on gene expression, and distributions among 
      subpopulations illustrate the utility of these resources for understanding how SVs 
      and gCNVs shaped rice environmental adaptation and domestication. Our graph-based 
      genome enabled genome-wide association study (GWAS)-based identification of 
      phenotype-associated genetic variations undetectable when using only SNPs and a 
      single reference assembly. Our work provides rich population-scale resources paired 
      with easy-to-access tools to facilitate rice breeding as well as plant functional 
      genomics and evolutionary biology research.

AB  - End resection in homologous recombination (HR) and HR-mediated repair of DNA 
      double-strand breaks (DSBs) removes several kilobases from 5' strands of DSBs, but 
      3' strands are exempted from degradation. The mechanism by which the 3' overhangs 
      are protected has not been determined. Here, we established that the protection of 
      3' overhangs is achieved through the transient formation of RNA-DNA hybrids. The DNA 
      strand in the hybrids is the 3' ssDNA overhang, while the RNA strand is newly 
      synthesized. RNA polymerase III (RNAPIII) is responsible for synthesizing the RNA 
      strand. Furthermore, RNAPIII is actively recruited to DSBs by the MRN complex. CtIP 
      and MRN nuclease activity is required for initiating the RNAPIII-mediated RNA 
      synthesis at DSBs. A reduced level of RNAPIII suppressed HR, and genetic loss > 
      30 bp increased at DSBs. Thus, RNAPIII is an essential HR factor, and the RNA-DNA 
      hybrid is an essential repair intermediate for protecting the 3' overhangs in DSB 
      repair.

AB  - The central pathogen-immune interface in tuberculosis is the granuloma, a complex 
      host immune structure that dictates infection trajectory and physiology. Granuloma 
      macrophages undergo a dramatic transition in which entire epithelial modules are 
      induced and define granuloma architecture. In tuberculosis, relatively little is 
      known about the host signals that trigger this transition. Using the 
      zebrafish-Mycobacterium marinum model, we identify the basis of granuloma macrophage 
      transformation. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of zebrafish granulomas and 
      analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis-infected macaques reveal that, even in the 
      presence of robust type 1 immune responses, countervailing type 2 signals associate 
      with macrophage epithelialization. We find that type 2 immune signaling, mediated 
      via stat6, is absolutely required for epithelialization and granuloma formation. In 
      mixed chimeras, stat6 acts cell autonomously within macrophages, where it is 
      required for epithelioid transformation and incorporation into necrotic granulomas. 
      These findings establish the signaling pathway that produces the hallmark structure 
      of mycobacterial infection.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 has caused the global COVID-19 pandemic. Although passively delivered 
      neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 show promise in clinical trials, their 
      mechanism of action in vivo is incompletely understood. Here, we define correlates 
      of protection of neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in 
      SARS-CoV-2-infected animals. Whereas Fc effector functions are dispensable when 
      representative neutralizing mAbs are administered as prophylaxis, they are required 
      for optimal protection as therapy. When given after infection, intact mAbs reduce 
      SARS-CoV-2 burden and lung disease in mice and hamsters better than loss-of-function 
      Fc variant mAbs. Fc engagement of neutralizing antibodies mitigates inflammation and 
      improves respiratory mechanics, and transcriptional profiling suggests these 
      phenotypes are associated with diminished innate immune signaling and preserved 
      tissue repair. Immune cell depletions establish that neutralizing mAbs require 
      monocytes and CD8(+) T cells for optimal clinical and virological benefit. Thus, 
      potently neutralizing mAbs utilize Fc effector functions during therapy to mitigate 
      lung infection and disease.

AB  - Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths, and greater knowledge of 
      the metastatic microenvironment is necessary to effectively target this process. 
      Microenvironmental changes occur at distant sites prior to clinically detectable 
      metastatic disease; however, the key niche regulatory signals during metastatic 
      progression remain poorly characterized. Here, we identify a core immune suppression 
      gene signature in pre-metastatic niche formation that is expressed predominantly by 
      myeloid cells. We target this immune suppression program by utilizing genetically 
      engineered myeloid cells (GEMys) to deliver IL-12 to modulate the metastatic 
      microenvironment. Our data demonstrate that IL12-GEMy treatment reverses immune 
      suppression in the pre-metastatic niche by activating antigen presentation and 
      T cell activation, resulting in reduced metastatic and primary tumor burden and 
      improved survival of tumor-bearing mice. We demonstrate that IL12-GEMys can 
      functionally modulate the core program of immune suppression in the pre-metastatic 
      niche to successfully rebalance the dysregulated metastatic microenvironment in 
      cancer.

AB  - Enzyme-mediated damage repair or mitigation, while common for nucleic acids, is rare 
      for proteins. Examples of protein damage are elimination of phosphorylated Ser/Thr 
      to dehydroalanine/dehydrobutyrine (Dha/Dhb) in pathogenesis and aging. Bacterial 
      LanC enzymes use Dha/Dhb to form carbon-sulfur linkages in antimicrobial peptides, 
      but the functions of eukaryotic LanC-like (LanCL) counterparts are unknown. We show 
      that LanCLs catalyze the addition of glutathione to Dha/Dhb in proteins, driving 
      irreversible C-glutathionylation. Chemo-enzymatic methods were developed to 
      site-selectively incorporate Dha/Dhb at phospho-regulated sites in kinases. In human 
      MAPK-MEK1, such "elimination damage" generated aberrantly activated kinases, which 
      were deactivated by LanCL-mediated C-glutathionylation. Surveys of endogenous 
      proteins bearing damage from elimination (the eliminylome) also suggest it is a 
      source of electrophilic reactivity. LanCLs thus remove these reactive electrophiles 
      and their potentially dysregulatory effects from the proteome. As knockout of LanCL 
      in mice can result in premature death, repair of this kind of protein damage appears 
      important physiologically.

AB  - The biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) requirement to culture severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a bottleneck for research. Here, we report a 
      trans-complementation system that produces single-round infectious SARS-CoV-2 that 
      recapitulates authentic viral replication. We demonstrate that the single-round 
      infectious SARS-CoV-2 can be used at BSL-2 laboratories for high-throughput 
      neutralization and antiviral testing. The trans-complementation system consists of 
      two components: a genomic viral RNA containing ORF3 and envelope gene deletions, as 
      well as mutated transcriptional regulator sequences, and a producer cell line 
      expressing the two deleted genes. Trans-complementation of the two components 
      generates virions that can infect naive cells for only one round but does not 
      produce wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Hamsters and K18-hACE2 transgenic mice inoculated with 
      the complementation-derived virions exhibited no detectable disease, even after 
      intracranial inoculation with the highest possible dose. Thus, the 
      trans-complementation platform can be safely used at BSL-2 laboratories for research 
      and countermeasure development.

TI  - Enteric helminth coinfection enhances host susceptibility to neurotropic

AB  - Although enteric helminth infections modulate immunity to mucosal pathogens, their 
      effects on systemic microbes remain less established. Here, we observe increased 
      mortality in mice coinfected with the enteric helminth Heligmosomoides polygyrus 
      bakeri (Hpb) and West Nile virus (WNV). This enhanced susceptibility is associated 
      with altered gut morphology and transit, translocation of commensal bacteria, 
      impaired WNV-specific T cell responses, and increased virus infection in the 
      gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system. These outcomes were due to type 2 
      immune skewing, because coinfection in Stat6(-/-) mice rescues mortality, treatment 
      of helminth-free WNV-infected mice with interleukin (IL)-4 mirrors coinfection, and 
      IL-4 receptor signaling in intestinal epithelial cells mediates the susceptibility 
      phenotypes. Moreover, tuft cell-deficient mice show improved outcomes with 
      coinfection, whereas treatment of helminth-free mice with tuft cell-derived cytokine 
      IL-25 or ligand succinate worsens WNV disease. Thus, helminth activation of tuft 
      cell-IL-4-receptor circuits in the gut exacerbates infection and disease of a 
      neurotropic flavivirus.

AB  - Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) because of MAPT mutation causes pathological 
      accumulation of tau and glutamatergic cortical neuronal death by unknown mechanisms. 
      We used human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cerebral organoids 
      expressing tau-V337M and isogenic corrected controls to discover early alterations 
      because of the mutation that precede neurodegeneration. At 2 months, mutant 
      organoids show upregulated expression of MAPT, glutamatergic signaling pathways, and 
      regulators, including the RNA-binding protein ELAVL4, and increased stress granules. 
      Over the following 4 months, mutant organoids accumulate splicing changes, 
      disruption of autophagy function, and build-up of tau and P-tau-S396. By 6 months, 
      tau-V337M organoids show specific loss of glutamatergic neurons as seen in 
      individuals with FTD. Mutant neurons are susceptible to glutamate toxicity, which 
      can be rescued pharmacologically by the PIKFYVE kinase inhibitor apilimod. Our 
      results demonstrate a sequence of events that precede neurodegeneration, revealing 
      molecular pathways associated with glutamate signaling as potential targets for 
      therapeutic intervention in FTD.

AB  - Thermogenic adipocytes possess a therapeutically appealing, energy-expending 
      capacity, which is canonically cold-induced by ligand-dependent activation of 
      β-adrenergic G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Here, we uncover an alternate 
      paradigm of GPCR-mediated adipose thermogenesis through the constitutively active 
      receptor, GPR3. We show that the N terminus of GPR3 confers intrinsic signaling 
      activity, resulting in continuous Gs-coupling and cAMP production without an 
      exogenous ligand. Thus, transcriptional induction of Gpr3 represents the regulatory 
      parallel to ligand-binding of conventional GPCRs. Consequently, increasing Gpr3 
      expression in thermogenic adipocytes is alone sufficient to drive energy expenditure 
      and counteract metabolic disease in mice. Gpr3 transcription is cold-stimulated by a 
      lipolytic signal, and dietary fat potentiates GPR3-dependent thermogenesis to 
      amplify the response to caloric excess. Moreover, we find GPR3 to be an essential, 
      adrenergic-independent regulator of human brown adipocytes. Taken together, our 
      findings reveal a noncanonical mechanism of GPCR control and thermogenic activation 
      through the lipolysis-induced expression of constitutively active GPR3.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been spreading 
      worldwide, causing a global pandemic. Bat-origin RaTG13 is currently the most 
      phylogenetically related virus. Here we obtained the complex structure of the RaTG13 
      receptor binding domain (RBD) with human ACE2 (hACE2) and evaluated binding of 
      RaTG13 RBD to 24 additional ACE2 orthologs. By substituting residues in the RaTG13 
      RBD with their counterparts in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD, we found that residue 501, the 
      major position found in variants of concern (VOCs) 501Y.V1/V2/V3, plays a key role 
      in determining the potential host range of RaTG13. We also found that SARS-CoV-2 
      could induce strong cross-reactive antibodies to RaTG13 and identified a SARS-CoV-2 
      monoclonal antibody (mAb), CB6, that could cross-neutralize RaTG13 pseudovirus. 
      These results elucidate the receptor binding and host adaption mechanisms of RaTG13 
      and emphasize the importance of continuous surveillance of coronaviruses (CoVs) 
      carried by animal reservoirs to prevent another spillover of CoVs.

AB  - Despite the discovery of animal coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, the 
      evolutionary origins of this virus are elusive. We describe a meta-transcriptomic 
      study of 411 bat samples collected from a small geographical region in Yunnan 
      province, China, between May 2019 and November 2020. We identified 24 full-length 
      coronavirus genomes, including four novel SARS-CoV-2-related and three 
      SARS-CoV-related viruses. Rhinolophus pusillus virus RpYN06 was the closest relative 
      of SARS-CoV-2 in most of the genome, although it possessed a more divergent spike 
      gene. The other three SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses carried a genetically 
      distinct spike gene that could weakly bind to the hACE2 receptor in vitro. 
      Ecological modeling predicted the co-existence of up to 23 Rhinolophus bat species, 
      with the largest contiguous hotspots extending from South Laos and Vietnam to 
      southern China. Our study highlights the remarkable diversity of bat coronaviruses 
      at the local scale, including close relatives of both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.

AB  - The activities of RNA polymerase and the spliceosome are responsible for the 
      heterogeneity in the abundance and isoform composition of mRNA in human cells. 
      However, the dynamics of these megadalton enzymatic complexes working in concert on 
      endogenous genes have not been described. Here, we establish a quasi-genome-scale 
      platform for observing synthesis and processing kinetics of single nascent RNA 
      molecules in real time. We find that all observed genes show transcriptional 
      bursting. We also observe large kinetic variation in intron removal for single 
      introns in single cells, which is inconsistent with deterministic splice site 
      selection. Transcriptome-wide footprinting of the U2AF complex, nascent RNA 
      profiling, long-read sequencing, and lariat sequencing further reveal widespread 
      stochastic recursive splicing within introns. We propose and validate a unified 
      theoretical model to explain the general features of transcription and pervasive 
      stochastic splice site selection.

AB  - Past human genetic diversity and migration between southern China and Southeast Asia 
      have not been well characterized, in part due to poor preservation of ancient DNA in 
      hot and humid regions. We sequenced 31 ancient genomes from southern China (Guangxi 
      and Fujian), including two ∼12,000- to 10,000-year-old individuals representing the 
      oldest humans sequenced from southern China. We discovered a deeply diverged East 
      Asian ancestry in the Guangxi region that persisted until at least 6,000 years ago. 
      We found that ∼9,000- to 6,000-year-old Guangxi populations were a mixture of local 
      ancestry, southern ancestry previously sampled in Fujian, and deep Asian ancestry 
      related to Southeast Asian Hòabìnhian hunter-gatherers, showing broad admixture in 
      the region predating the appearance of farming. Historical Guangxi populations 
      dating to ∼1,500 to 500 years ago are closely related to Tai-Kadai and Hmong-Mien 
      speakers. Our results show heavy interactions among three distinct ancestries at the 
      crossroads of East and Southeast Asia.

AB  - Poor tumor infiltration, development of exhaustion, and antigen insufficiency are 
      common mechanisms that limit chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell efficacy. 
      Delivery of pattern recognition receptor agonists is one strategy to improve immune 
      function; however, targeting these agonists to immune cells is challenging, and 
      off-target signaling in cancer cells can be detrimental. Here, we engineer CAR-T 
      cells to deliver RN7SL1, an endogenous RNA that activates RIG-I/MDA5 signaling. 
      RN7SL1 promotes expansion and effector-memory differentiation of CAR-T cells. 
      Moreover, RN7SL1 is deployed in extracellular vesicles and selectively transferred 
      to immune cells. Unlike other RNA agonists, transferred RN7SL1 restricts 
      myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) development, decreases TGFB in myeloid cells, 
      and fosters dendritic cell (DC) subsets with costimulatory features. Consequently, 
      endogenous effector-memory and tumor-specific T cells also expand, allowing 
      rejection of solid tumors with CAR antigen loss. Supported by improved endogenous 
      immunity, CAR-T cells can now co-deploy peptide antigens with RN7SL1 to enhance 
      efficacy, even when heterogenous CAR antigen tumors lack adequate neoantigens.

AB  - Cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses against tumors are maintained by stem-like 
      memory cells that self-renew but also give rise to effector-like cells. The latter 
      gradually lose their anti-tumor activity and acquire an epigenetically fixed, 
      hypofunctional state, leading to tumor tolerance. Here, we show that the conversion 
      of stem-like into effector-like CTLs involves a major chemotactic reprogramming that 
      includes the upregulation of chemokine receptor CXCR6. This receptor positions 
      effector-like CTLs in a discrete perivascular niche of the tumor stroma that is 
      densely occupied by CCR7(+) dendritic cells (DCs) expressing the CXCR6 ligand 
      CXCL16. CCR7(+) DCs also express and trans-present the survival cytokine 
      interleukin-15 (IL-15). CXCR6 expression and IL-15 trans-presentation are critical 
      for the survival and local expansion of effector-like CTLs in the tumor 
      microenvironment to maximize their anti-tumor activity before progressing to 
      irreversible dysfunction. These observations reveal a cellular and molecular 
      checkpoint that determines the magnitude and outcome of anti-tumor immune responses.

TI  - Scap structures highlight key role for rotation of intertwined luminal loops in 
      cholesterol sensing.

AB  - The cholesterol-sensing protein Scap induces cholesterol synthesis by transporting 
      membrane-bound transcription factors called sterol regulatory element-binding 
      proteins (SREBPs) from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus for 
      proteolytic activation. Transport requires interaction between Scap's two ER luminal 
      loops (L1 and L7), which flank an intramembrane sterol-sensing domain (SSD). 
      Cholesterol inhibits Scap transport by binding to L1, which triggers Scap's binding 
      to Insig, an ER retention protein. Here we used cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) to 
      elucidate two structures of full-length chicken Scap: (1) a wild-type free of Insigs 
      and (2) mutant Scap bound to chicken Insig without cholesterol. Strikingly, L1 and 
      L7 intertwine tightly to form a globular domain that acts as a luminal platform 
      connecting the SSD to the rest of Scap. In the presence of Insig, this platform 
      undergoes a large rotation accompanied by rearrangement of Scap's transmembrane 
      helices. We postulate that this conformational change halts Scap transport of SREBPs 
      and inhibits cholesterol synthesis.

TI  - The monoclonal antibody combination REGEN-COV protects against SARS-CoV-2 mutational 
      escape in preclinical and human studies.

AB  - Monoclonal antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are a clinically validated therapeutic 
      option against COVID-19. Because rapidly emerging virus mutants are becoming the 
      next major concern in the fight against the global pandemic, it is imperative that 
      these therapeutic treatments provide coverage against circulating variants and do 
      not contribute to development of treatment-induced emergent resistance. To this end, 
      we investigated the sequence diversity of the spike protein and monitored emergence 
      of virus variants in SARS-COV-2 isolates found in COVID-19 patients treated with the 
      two-antibody combination REGEN-COV, as well as in preclinical in vitro studies using 
      single, dual, or triple antibody combinations, and in hamster in vivo studies using 
      REGEN-COV or single monoclonal antibody treatments. Our study demonstrates that the 
      combination of non-competing antibodies in REGEN-COV provides protection against all 
      current SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern/interest and also protects against emergence 
      of new variants and their potential seeding into the population in a clinical 
      setting.

AB  - Interspecies chimera formation with human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) represents 
      a necessary alternative to evaluate hPSC pluripotency in vivo and might constitute a 
      promising strategy for various regenerative medicine applications, including the 
      generation of organs and tissues for transplantation. Studies using mouse and pig 
      embryos suggest that hPSCs do not robustly contribute to chimera formation in 
      species evolutionarily distant to humans. We studied the chimeric competency of 
      human extended pluripotent stem cells (hEPSCs) in cynomolgus monkey (Macaca 
      fascicularis) embryos cultured ex vivo. We demonstrate that hEPSCs survived, 
      proliferated, and generated several peri- and early post-implantation cell lineages 
      inside monkey embryos. We also uncovered signaling events underlying interspecific 
      crosstalk that may help shape the unique developmental trajectories of human and 
      monkey cells within chimeric embryos. These results may help to better understand 
      early human development and primate evolution and develop strategies to improve 
      human chimerism in evolutionarily distant species.

AB  - GRN mutations cause frontotemporal dementia (GRN-FTD) due to deficiency in 
      progranulin (PGRN), a lysosomal and secreted protein with unclear function. Here, we 
      found that Grn(-/-) mice exhibit a global deficiency in 
      bis(monoacylglycero)phosphate (BMP), an endolysosomal phospholipid we identified as 
      a pH-dependent PGRN interactor as well as a redox-sensitive enhancer of lysosomal 
      proteolysis and lipolysis. Grn(-/-) brains also showed an age-dependent, secondary 
      storage of glucocerebrosidase substrate glucosylsphingosine. We investigated a 
      protein replacement strategy by engineering protein transport vehicle (PTV):PGRN-a 
      recombinant protein linking PGRN to a modified Fc domain that binds human 
      transferrin receptor for enhanced CNS biodistribution. PTV:PGRN rescued various 
      Grn(-/-) phenotypes in primary murine macrophages and human iPSC-derived microglia, 
      including oxidative stress, lysosomal dysfunction, and endomembrane damage. 
      Peripherally delivered PTV:PGRN corrected levels of BMP, glucosylsphingosine, and 
      disease pathology in Grn(-/-) CNS, including microgliosis, lipofuscinosis, and 
      neuronal damage. PTV:PGRN thus represents a potential biotherapeutic for GRN-FTD.

AB  - Most human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 recognize the spike 
      (S) protein receptor-binding domain and block virus interactions with the cellular 
      receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. We describe a panel of human mAbs binding 
      to diverse epitopes on the N-terminal domain (NTD) of S protein from SARS-CoV-2 
      convalescent donors and found a minority of these possessed neutralizing activity. 
      Two mAbs (COV2-2676 and COV2-2489) inhibited infection of authentic SARS-CoV-2 and 
      recombinant VSV/SARS-CoV-2 viruses. We mapped their binding epitopes by 
      alanine-scanning mutagenesis and selection of functional SARS-CoV-2 S neutralization 
      escape variants. Mechanistic studies showed that these antibodies neutralize in part 
      by inhibiting a post-attachment step in the infection cycle. COV2-2676 and COV2-2489 
      offered protection either as prophylaxis or therapy, and Fc effector functions were 
      required for optimal protection. Thus, natural infection induces a subset of potent 
      NTD-specific mAbs that leverage neutralizing and Fc-mediated activities to protect 
      against SARS-CoV-2 infection using multiple functional attributes.

AB  - Replacing or editing disease-causing mutations holds great promise for treating many 
      human diseases. Yet, delivering therapeutic genetic modifiers to specific cells 
      in vivo has been challenging, particularly in large, anatomically distributed 
      tissues such as skeletal muscle. Here, we establish an in vivo strategy to evolve 
      and stringently select capsid variants of adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) that 
      enable potent delivery to desired tissues. Using this method, we identify a class of 
      RGD motif-containing capsids that transduces muscle with superior efficiency and 
      selectivity after intravenous injection in mice and non-human primates. We 
      demonstrate substantially enhanced potency and therapeutic efficacy of these 
      engineered vectors compared to naturally occurring AAV capsids in two mouse models 
      of genetic muscle disease. The top capsid variants from our selection approach show 
      conserved potency for delivery across a variety of inbred mouse strains, and in 
      cynomolgus macaques and human primary myotubes, with transduction dependent on 
      target cell expressed integrin heterodimers.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the 
      ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Understanding of the RNA virus 
      and its interactions with host proteins could improve therapeutic interventions for 
      COVID-19. By using icSHAPE, we determined the structural landscape of SARS-CoV-2 RNA 
      in infected human cells and from refolded RNAs, as well as the regulatory 
      untranslated regions of SARS-CoV-2 and six other coronaviruses. We validated several 
      structural elements predicted in silico and discovered structural features that 
      affect the translation and abundance of subgenomic viral RNAs in cells. The 
      structural data informed a deep-learning tool to predict 42 host proteins that bind 
      to SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Strikingly, antisense oligonucleotides targeting the structural 
      elements and FDA-approved drugs inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 RNA binding proteins 
      dramatically reduced SARS-CoV-2 infection in cells derived from human liver and lung 
      tumors. Our findings thus shed light on coronavirus and reveal multiple candidate 
      therapeutics for COVID-19 treatment.

AB  - We study a patient with the human papilloma virus (HPV)-2-driven "tree-man" 
      phenotype and two relatives with unusually severe HPV4-driven warts. The giant horns 
      form an HPV-2-driven multifocal benign epithelial tumor overexpressing viral 
      oncogenes in the epidermis basal layer. The patients are unexpectedly homozygous for 
      a private CD28 variant. They have no detectable CD28 on their T cells, with the 
      exception of a small contingent of revertant memory CD4(+) T cells. T cell 
      development is barely affected, and T cells respond to CD3 and CD2, but not CD28, 
      costimulation. Although the patients do not display HPV-2- and HPV-4-reactive CD4(+) 
      T cells in vitro, they make antibodies specific for both viruses in vivo. 
      CD28-deficient mice are susceptible to cutaneous infections with the mouse 
      papillomavirus MmuPV1. The control of HPV-2 and HPV-4 in keratinocytes is dependent 
      on the T cell CD28 co-activation pathway. Surprisingly, human CD28-dependent T cell 
      responses are largely redundant for protective immunity.

AB  - We have recently identified a novel lymphocyte that is a dual expresser (DE) of 
      TCRαβ and BCR. DEs in T1D patients are predominated by a public BCR clonotype 
      (clone-x) that encodes a potent autoantigen that cross-activates insulin-reactive 
      T cells. Betts and colleagues were able to detect DEs but alleged to not detect high 
      DE frequency, clone-x, or similar clones in T1D patients. Unfortunately, the authors 
      did not follow our methods and when they did, their flow cytometric data at two 
      sites were conflicting. Moreover, contrary to their claim, we identified clones 
      similar to clone-x in their data along with clones bearing the core motif 
      (DTAMVYYFDYW). Additionally, their report of no increased usage of clone-x VH/DH 
      genes by bulk B cells confirms rather than challenges our results. Finally, the 
      authors failed to provide data verifying purity of their sorted DEs, making it 
      difficult to draw reliable conclusion of their repertoire analysis. This Matters

TI  - Iterative tomography with digital adaptive optics permits hour-long intravital 
      observation of 3D subcellular dynamics at millisecond scale.

AB  - Long-term subcellular intravital imaging in mammals is vital to study diverse 
      intercellular behaviors and organelle functions during native physiological 
      processes. However, optical heterogeneity, tissue opacity, and phototoxicity pose 
      great challenges. Here, we propose a computational imaging framework, termed digital 
      adaptive optics scanning light-field mutual iterative tomography (DAOSLIMIT), 
      featuring high-speed, high-resolution 3D imaging, tiled wavefront correction, and 
      low phototoxicity with a compact system. By tomographic imaging of the entire volume 
      simultaneously, we obtained volumetric imaging across 225 × 225 × 16 μm(3), with a 
      resolution of up to 220 nm laterally and 400 nm axially, at the millisecond scale, 
      over hundreds of thousands of time points. To establish the capabilities, we 
      investigated large-scale cell migration and neural activities in different species 
      and observed various subcellular dynamics in mammals during neutrophil migration and 
      tumor cell circulation.

AB  - Interleukin-12 (IL-12) and IL-23 are heterodimeric cytokines that are produced by 
      antigen-presenting cells to regulate the activation and differentiation of 
      lymphocytes, and they share IL-12Rβ1 as a receptor signaling subunit. We present a 
      crystal structure of the quaternary IL-23 (IL-23p19/p40)/IL-23R/IL-12Rβ1 complex, 
      together with cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) maps of the complete IL-12 
      (IL-12p35/p40)/IL-12Rβ2/IL-12Rβ1 and IL-23 receptor (IL-23R) complexes, which reveal 
      "non-canonical" topologies where IL-12Rβ1 directly engages the common p40 subunit. 
      We targeted the shared IL-12Rβ1/p40 interface to design a panel of IL-12 partial 
      agonists that preserved interferon gamma (IFNγ) induction by CD8(+) T cells but 
      impaired cytokine production from natural killer (NK) cells in vitro. These 
      cell-biased properties were recapitulated in vivo, where IL-12 partial agonists 
      elicited anti-tumor immunity to MC-38 murine adenocarcinoma absent the 
      NK-cell-mediated toxicity seen with wild-type IL-12. Thus, the structural mechanism 
      of receptor sharing used by IL-12 family cytokines provides a protein interface 
      blueprint for tuning this cytokine axis for therapeutics.

AB  - A fraction of mature T cells can be activated by peripheral self-antigens, 
      potentially eliciting host autoimmunity. We investigated homeostatic control of 
      self-activated T cells within unperturbed tissue environments by combining 
      high-resolution multiplexed and volumetric imaging with computational modeling. In 
      lymph nodes, self-activated T cells produced interleukin (IL)-2, which enhanced 
      local regulatory T cell (Treg) proliferation and inhibitory functionality. The 
      resulting micro-domains reciprocally constrained inputs required for damaging 
      effector responses, including CD28 co-stimulation and IL-2 signaling, constituting a 
      negative feedback circuit. Due to these local constraints, self-activated T cells 
      underwent transient clonal expansion, followed by rapid death ("pruning"). 
      Computational simulations and experimental manipulations revealed the feedback 
      machinery's quantitative limits: modest reductions in Treg micro-domain density or 
      functionality produced non-linear breakdowns in control, enabling self-activated 
      T cells to subvert pruning. This fine-tuned, paracrine feedback process not only 
      enforces immune homeostasis but also establishes a sharp boundary between autoimmune 
      and host-protective T cell responses.

AB  - Understanding how potent neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) inhibit SARS-CoV-2 is 
      critical for effective therapeutic development. We previously described BD-368-2, a 
      SARS-CoV-2 NAb with high potency; however, its neutralization mechanism is largely 
      unknown. Here, we report the 3.5-Å cryo-EM structure of BD-368-2/trimeric-spike 
      complex, revealing that BD-368-2 fully blocks ACE2 recognition by occupying all 
      three receptor-binding domains (RBDs) simultaneously, regardless of their "up" or 
      "down" conformations. Also, BD-368-2 treats infected adult hamsters at low dosages 
      and at various administering windows, in contrast to placebo hamsters that 
      manifested severe interstitial pneumonia. Moreover, BD-368-2's epitope completely 
      avoids the common binding site of VH3-53/VH3-66 recurrent NAbs, evidenced by 
      tripartite co-crystal structures with RBDs. Pairing BD-368-2 with a potent recurrent 
      NAb neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus at pM level and rescues mutation-induced 
      neutralization escapes. Together, our results rationalized a new RBD epitope that 
      leads to high neutralization potency and demonstrated BD-368-2's therapeutic 
      potential in treating COVID-19.

AB  - Cardiomyocytes are subjected to the intense mechanical stress and metabolic demands 
      of the beating heart. It is unclear whether these cells, which are long-lived and 
      rarely renew, manage to preserve homeostasis on their own. While analyzing 
      macrophages lodged within the healthy myocardium, we discovered that they actively 
      took up material, including mitochondria, derived from cardiomyocytes. 
      Cardiomyocytes ejected dysfunctional mitochondria and other cargo in dedicated 
      membranous particles reminiscent of neural exophers, through a process driven by the 
      cardiomyocyte's autophagy machinery that was enhanced during cardiac stress. 
      Depletion of cardiac macrophages or deficiency in the phagocytic receptor Mertk 
      resulted in defective elimination of mitochondria from the myocardial tissue, 
      activation of the inflammasome, impaired autophagy, accumulation of anomalous 
      mitochondria in cardiomyocytes, metabolic alterations, and ventricular dysfunction. 
      Thus, we identify an immune-parenchymal pair in the murine heart that enables 
      transfer of unfit material to preserve metabolic stability and organ function. VIDEO

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause severe respiratory COVID-19. However, many 
      individuals present with isolated upper respiratory symptoms, suggesting potential 
      to constrain viral pathology to the nasopharynx. Which cells SARS-CoV-2 primarily 
      targets and how infection influences the respiratory epithelium remains incompletely 
      understood. We performed scRNA-seq on nasopharyngeal swabs from 58 healthy and 
      COVID-19 participants. During COVID-19, we observe expansion of secretory, loss of 
      ciliated, and epithelial cell repopulation via deuterosomal cell expansion. In mild 
      and moderate COVID-19, epithelial cells express anti-viral/interferon-responsive 
      genes, while cells in severe COVID-19 have muted anti-viral responses despite 
      equivalent viral loads. SARS-CoV-2 RNA(+) host-target cells are highly heterogenous, 
      including developing ciliated, interferon-responsive ciliated, AZGP1(high) goblet, 
      and KRT13(+) "hillock"-like cells, and we identify genes associated with 
      susceptibility, resistance, or infection response. Our study defines protective and 
      detrimental responses to SARS-CoV-2, the direct viral targets of infection, and 
      suggests that failed nasal epithelial anti-viral immunity may underlie and precede 
      severe COVID-19.

AB  - Improving effector activity of antigen-specific T cells is a major goal in cancer 
      immunotherapy. Despite the identification of several effector T cell 
      (T(EFF))-driving transcription factors (TFs), the transcriptional coordination of 
      T(EFF) biology remains poorly understood. We developed an in vivo T cell CRISPR 
      screening platform and identified a key mechanism restraining T(EFF) biology through 
      the ETS family TF, Fli1. Genetic deletion of Fli1 enhanced T(EFF) responses without 
      compromising memory or exhaustion precursors. Fli1 restrained T(EFF) lineage 
      differentiation by binding to cis-regulatory elements of effector-associated genes. 
      Loss of Fli1 increased chromatin accessibility at ETS:RUNX motifs, allowing more 
      efficient Runx3-driven T(EFF) biology. CD8(+) T cells lacking Fli1 provided 
      substantially better protection against multiple infections and tumors. These data 
      indicate that Fli1 safeguards the developing CD8(+) T cell transcriptional landscape 
      from excessive ETS:RUNX-driven T(EFF) cell differentiation. Moreover, genetic 
      deletion of Fli1 improves T(EFF) differentiation and protective immunity in 
      infections and cancer.

AB  - Components of the proteostasis network malfunction in aging, and reduced protein 
      quality control in neurons has been proposed to promote neurodegeneration. Here, we 
      investigate the role of chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), a selective autophagy 
      shown to degrade neurodegeneration-related proteins, in neuronal proteostasis. Using 
      mouse models with systemic and neuronal-specific CMA blockage, we demonstrate that 
      loss of neuronal CMA leads to altered neuronal function, selective changes in the 
      neuronal metastable proteome, and proteotoxicity, all reminiscent of brain aging. 
      Imposing CMA loss on a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has synergistic 
      negative effects on the proteome at risk of aggregation, thus increasing neuronal 
      disease vulnerability and accelerating disease progression. Conversely, chemical 
      enhancement of CMA ameliorates pathology in two different AD experimental mouse 
      models. We conclude that functional CMA is essential for neuronal proteostasis 
      through the maintenance of a subset of the proteome with a higher risk of misfolding 
      than the general proteome.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the largest non-genetic, non-aging related risk 
      factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We report here that TBI induces tau acetylation 
      (ac-tau) at sites acetylated also in human AD brain. This is mediated by 
      S-nitrosylated-GAPDH, which simultaneously inactivates Sirtuin1 deacetylase and 
      activates p300/CBP acetyltransferase, increasing neuronal ac-tau. Subsequent tau 
      mislocalization causes neurodegeneration and neurobehavioral impairment, and ac-tau 
      accumulates in the blood. Blocking GAPDH S-nitrosylation, inhibiting p300/CBP, or 
      stimulating Sirtuin1 all protect mice from neurodegeneration, neurobehavioral 
      impairment, and blood and brain accumulation of ac-tau after TBI. Ac-tau is thus a 
      therapeutic target and potential blood biomarker of TBI that may represent 
      pathologic convergence between TBI and AD. Increased ac-tau in human AD brain is 
      further augmented in AD patients with history of TBI, and patients receiving the 
      p300/CBP inhibitors salsalate or diflunisal exhibit decreased incidence of AD and

AB  - The most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and 
      frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a GGGGCC repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene. We 
      developed a platform to interrogate the chromatin accessibility landscape and 
      transcriptional program within neurons during degeneration. We provide evidence that 
      neurons expressing the dipeptide repeat protein poly(proline-arginine), translated 
      from the C9orf72 repeat expansion, activate a highly specific transcriptional 
      program, exemplified by a single transcription factor, p53. Ablating p53 in mice 
      completely rescued neurons from degeneration and markedly increased survival in a 
      C9orf72 mouse model. p53 reduction also rescued axonal degeneration caused by 
      poly(glycine-arginine), increased survival of C9orf72 ALS/FTD-patient-induced 
      pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived motor neurons, and mitigated neurodegeneration 
      in a C9orf72 fly model. We show that p53 activates a downstream transcriptional 
      program, including Puma, which drives neurodegeneration. These data demonstrate a 
      neurodegenerative mechanism dynamically regulated through 
      transcription-factor-binding events and provide a framework to apply chromatin 
      accessibility and transcription program profiles to neurodegeneration.

TI  - Baricitinib treatment resolves lower-airway macrophage inflammation and neutrophil 
      recruitment in SARS-CoV-2-infected rhesus macaques.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2-induced hypercytokinemia and inflammation are critically associated with 
      COVID-19 severity. Baricitinib, a clinically approved JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, is 
      currently being investigated in COVID-19 clinical trials. Here, we investigated the 
      immunologic and virologic efficacy of baricitinib in a rhesus macaque model of 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection. Viral shedding measured from nasal and throat swabs, 
      bronchoalveolar lavages, and tissues was not reduced with baricitinib. Type I 
      interferon (IFN) antiviral responses and SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses 
      remained similar between the two groups. Animals treated with baricitinib showed 
      reduced inflammation, decreased lung infiltration of inflammatory cells, reduced 
      NETosis activity, and more limited lung pathology. Importantly, baricitinib-treated 
      animals had a rapid and remarkably potent suppression of lung macrophage production 
      of cytokines and chemokines responsible for inflammation and neutrophil recruitment. 
      These data support a beneficial role for, and elucidate the immunological mechanisms 
      underlying, the use of baricitinib as a frontline treatment for inflammation induced 
      by SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - Natural antibodies (Abs) can target host glycans on the surface of pathogens. We 
      studied the evolution of glycan-reactive B cells of rhesus macaques and humans using 
      glycosylated HIV-1 envelope (Env) as a model antigen. 2G12 is a broadly neutralizing 
      Ab (bnAb) that targets a conserved glycan patch on Env of geographically diverse 
      HIV-1 strains using a unique heavy-chain (V(H)) domain-swapped architecture that 
      results in fragment antigen-binding (Fab) dimerization. Here, we describe HIV-1 Env 
      Fab-dimerized glycan (FDG)-reactive bnAbs without V(H)-swapped domains from 
      simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)-infected macaques. FDG Abs also 
      recognized cell-surface glycans on diverse pathogens, including yeast and severe 
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike. FDG precursors were 
      expanded by glycan-bearing immunogens in macaques and were abundant in HIV-1-naive 
      humans. Moreover, FDG precursors were predominately mutated IgM(+)IgD(+)CD27(+), 
      thus suggesting that they originated from a pool of antigen-experienced IgM(+) or 
      marginal zone B cells.

AB  - Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) genes have well-established and important impacts on 
      molecular and cellular functions. However, among the thousands of lncRNA genes, it 
      is still a major challenge to identify the subset with disease or trait relevance. 
      To systematically characterize these lncRNA genes, we used Genotype Tissue 
      Expression (GTEx) project v8 genetic and multi-tissue transcriptomic data to profile 
      the expression, genetic regulation, cellular contexts, and trait associations of 
      14,100 lncRNA genes across 49 tissues for 101 distinct complex genetic traits. Using 
      these approaches, we identified 1,432 lncRNA gene-trait associations, 800 of which 
      were not explained by stronger effects of neighboring protein-coding genes. This 
      included associations between lncRNA quantitative trait loci and inflammatory bowel 
      disease, type 1 and type 2 diabetes, and coronary artery disease, as well as rare 
      variant associations to body mass index.

AB  - Ebola virus (EBOV) causes epidemics with high mortality yet remains understudied due 
      to the challenge of experimentation in high-containment and outbreak settings. Here, 
      we used single-cell transcriptomics and CyTOF-based single-cell protein 
      quantification to characterize peripheral immune cells during EBOV infection in 
      rhesus monkeys. We obtained 100,000 transcriptomes and 15,000,000 protein profiles, 
      finding that immature, proliferative monocyte-lineage cells with reduced 
      antigen-presentation capacity replace conventional monocyte subsets, while 
      lymphocytes upregulate apoptosis genes and decline in abundance. By quantifying 
      intracellular viral RNA, we identify molecular determinants of tropism among 
      circulating immune cells and examine temporal dynamics in viral and host gene 
      expression. Within infected cells, EBOV downregulates STAT1 mRNA and interferon 
      signaling, and it upregulates putative pro-viral genes (e.g., DYNLL1 and HSPA5), 
      nominating pathways the virus manipulates for its replication. This study sheds 
      light on EBOV tropism, replication dynamics, and elicited immune response and 
      provides a framework for characterizing host-virus interactions under maximum

AB  - Lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) remains a leading cause of cancer death with few 
      therapeutic options. We characterized the proteogenomic landscape of LSCC, providing 
      a deeper exposition of LSCC biology with potential therapeutic implications. We 
      identify NSD3 as an alternative driver in FGFR1-amplified tumors and low-p63 tumors 
      overexpressing the therapeutic target survivin. SOX2 is considered undruggable, but 
      our analyses provide rationale for exploring chromatin modifiers such as LSD1 and 
      EZH2 to target SOX2-overexpressing tumors. Our data support complex regulation of 
      metabolic pathways by crosstalk between post-translational modifications including 
      ubiquitylation. Numerous immune-related proteogenomic observations suggest 
      directions for further investigation. Proteogenomic dissection of CDKN2A mutations 
      argue for more nuanced assessment of RB1 protein expression and phosphorylation 
      before declaring CDK4/6 inhibition unsuccessful. Finally, triangulation between 
      LSCC, LUAD, and HNSCC identified both unique and common therapeutic vulnerabilities. 
      These observations and proteogenomics data resources may guide research into the 
      biology and treatment of LSCC.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has undergone 
      progressive change, with variants conferring advantage rapidly becoming dominant 
      lineages, e.g., B.1.617. With apparent increased transmissibility, variant B.1.617.2 
      has contributed to the current wave of infection ravaging the Indian subcontinent 
      and has been designated a variant of concern in the United Kingdom. Here we study 
      the ability of monoclonal antibodies and convalescent and vaccine sera to neutralize 
      B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2, complement this with structural analyses of Fab/receptor 
      binding domain (RBD) complexes, and map the antigenic space of current variants. 
      Neutralization of both viruses is reduced compared with ancestral Wuhan-related 
      strains, but there is no evidence of widespread antibody escape as seen with 
      B.1.351. However, B.1.351 and P.1 sera showed markedly more reduction in 
      neutralization of B.1.617.2, suggesting that individuals infected previously by 
      these variants may be more susceptible to reinfection by B.1.617.2. This observation 
      provides important new insights for immunization policy with future variant vaccines 
      in non-immune populations.

AB  - Immune responses to cancer are highly variable, with mismatch repair-deficient 
      (MMRd) tumors exhibiting more anti-tumor immunity than mismatch repair-proficient 
      (MMRp) tumors. To understand the rules governing these varied responses, we 
      transcriptionally profiled 371,223 cells from colorectal tumors and adjacent normal 
      tissues of 28 MMRp and 34 MMRd individuals. Analysis of 88 cell subsets and their 
      204 associated gene expression programs revealed extensive transcriptional and 
      spatial remodeling across tumors. To discover hubs of interacting malignant and 
      immune cells, we identified expression programs in different cell types that 
      co-varied across tumors from affected individuals and used spatial profiling to 
      localize coordinated programs. We discovered a myeloid cell-attracting hub at the 
      tumor-luminal interface associated with tissue damage and an MMRd-enriched immune 
      hub within the tumor, with activated T cells together with malignant and myeloid 
      cells expressing T cell-attracting chemokines. By identifying interacting cellular 
      programs, we reveal the logic underlying spatially organized immune-malignant cell 
      networks.

AB  - The ongoing pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2) is currently affecting millions of lives worldwide. Large retrospective 
      studies indicate that an elevated level of inflammatory cytokines and 
      pro-inflammatory factors are associated with both increased disease severity and 
      mortality. Here, using multidimensional epigenetic, transcriptional, in vitro, and 
      in vivo analyses, we report that topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) inhibition suppresses lethal 
      inflammation induced by SARS-CoV-2. Therapeutic treatment with two doses of 
      topotecan (TPT), an FDA-approved TOP1 inhibitor, suppresses infection-induced 
      inflammation in hamsters. TPT treatment as late as 4 days post-infection reduces 
      morbidity and rescues mortality in a transgenic mouse model. These results support 
      the potential of TOP1 inhibition as an effective host-directed therapy against 
      severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. TPT and its derivatives are inexpensive clinical-grade 
      inhibitors available in most countries. Clinical trials are needed to evaluate the 
      efficacy of repurposing TOP1 inhibitors for severe coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19) in humans.

AB  - Ras GTPase-activating protein-binding proteins 1 and 2 (G3BP1 and G3BP2, 
      respectively) are widely recognized as core components of stress granules (SGs). We 
      report that G3BPs reside at the cytoplasmic surface of lysosomes. They act in a 
      non-redundant manner to anchor the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) protein complex 
      to lysosomes and suppress activation of the metabolic master regulator mechanistic 
      target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) by amino acids and insulin. Like the TSC 
      complex, G3BP1 deficiency elicits phenotypes related to mTORC1 hyperactivity. In the 
      context of tumors, low G3BP1 levels enhance mTORC1-driven breast cancer cell 
      motility and correlate with adverse outcomes in patients. Furthermore, G3bp1 
      inhibition in zebrafish disturbs neuronal development and function, leading to white 
      matter heterotopia and neuronal hyperactivity. Thus, G3BPs are not only core 
      components of SGs but also a key element of lysosomal TSC-mTORC1 signaling.

AB  - Trained immunity, a functional state of myeloid cells, has been proposed as a 
      compelling immune-oncological target. Its efficient induction requires direct 
      engagement of myeloid progenitors in the bone marrow. For this purpose, we developed 
      a bone marrow-avid nanobiologic platform designed specifically to induce trained 
      immunity. We established the potent anti-tumor capabilities of our lead candidate 
      MTP(10)-HDL in a B16F10 mouse melanoma model. These anti-tumor effects result from 
      trained immunity-induced myelopoiesis caused by epigenetic rewiring of multipotent 
      progenitors in the bone marrow, which overcomes the immunosuppressive tumor 
      microenvironment. Furthermore, MTP(10)-HDL nanotherapy potentiates checkpoint 
      inhibition in this melanoma model refractory to anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapy. 
      Finally, we determined MTP(10)-HDL's favorable biodistribution and safety profile in 
      non-human primates. In conclusion, we show that rationally designed nanobiologics 
      can promote trained immunity and elicit a durable anti-tumor response either as a 
      monotherapy or in combination with checkpoint inhibitor drugs.

TI  - Key Parameters of Tumor Epitope Immunogenicity Revealed Through a Consortium 
      Approach Improve Neoantigen Prediction.

AB  - Many approaches to identify therapeutically relevant neoantigens couple tumor 
      sequencing with bioinformatic algorithms and inferred rules of tumor epitope 
      immunogenicity. However, there are no reference data to compare these approaches, 
      and the parameters governing tumor epitope immunogenicity remain unclear. Here, we 
      assembled a global consortium wherein each participant predicted immunogenic 
      epitopes from shared tumor sequencing data. 608 epitopes were subsequently assessed 
      for T cell binding in patient-matched samples. By integrating peptide features 
      associated with presentation and recognition, we developed a model of tumor epitope 
      immunogenicity that filtered out 98% of non-immunogenic peptides with a precision 
      above 0.70. Pipelines prioritizing model features had superior performance, and 
      pipeline alterations leveraging them improved prediction performance. These findings 
      were validated in an independent cohort of 310 epitopes prioritized from tumor 
      sequencing data and assessed for T cell binding. This data resource enables 
      identification of parameters underlying effective anti-tumor immunity and is 
      available to the research community.

AB  - Global dispersal and increasing frequency of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein variant 
      D614G are suggestive of a selective advantage but may also be due to a random 
      founder effect. We investigate the hypothesis for positive selection of spike D614G 
      in the United Kingdom using more than 25,000 whole genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences. 
      Despite the availability of a large dataset, well represented by both spike 614 
      variants, not all approaches showed a conclusive signal of positive selection. 
      Population genetic analysis indicates that 614G increases in frequency relative to 
      614D in a manner consistent with a selective advantage. We do not find any 
      indication that patients infected with the spike 614G variant have higher COVID-19 
      mortality or clinical severity, but 614G is associated with higher viral load and 
      younger age of patients. Significant differences in growth and size of 614G 
      phylogenetic clusters indicate a need for continued study of this variant.

TI  - Single-Cell Analyses Identify Brain Mural Cells Expressing CD19 as Potential 
      Off-Tumor Targets for CAR-T Immunotherapies.

AB  - CD19-directed immunotherapies are clinically effective for treating B cell 
      malignancies but also cause a high incidence of neurotoxicity. A subset of patients 
      treated with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells or bispecific T cell engager 
      (BiTE) antibodies display severe neurotoxicity, including fatal cerebral edema 
      associated with T cell infiltration into the brain. Here, we report that mural 
      cells, which surround the endothelium and are critical for blood-brain-barrier 
      integrity, express CD19. We identify CD19 expression in brain mural cells using 
      single-cell RNA sequencing data and confirm perivascular staining at the protein 
      level. CD19 expression in the brain begins early in development alongside the 
      emergence of mural cell lineages and persists throughout adulthood across brain 
      regions. Mouse mural cells demonstrate lower levels of Cd19 expression, suggesting 
      limitations in preclinical animal models of neurotoxicity. These data suggest an 
      on-target mechanism for neurotoxicity in CD19-directed therapies and highlight the 
      utility of human single-cell atlases for designing immunotherapies.

TI  - Targeting Pin1 renders pancreatic cancer eradicable by synergizing with 
      immunochemotherapy.

AB  - Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is characterized by notorious resistance to 
      current therapies attributed to inherent tumor heterogeneity and highly desmoplastic 
      and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Unique proline isomerase Pin1 
      regulates multiple cancer pathways, but its role in the TME and cancer immunotherapy 
      is unknown. Here, we find that Pin1 is overexpressed both in cancer cells and 
      cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and correlates with poor survival in PDAC 
      patients. Targeting Pin1 using clinically available drugs induces complete 
      elimination or sustained remissions of aggressive PDAC by synergizing with anti-PD-1 
      and gemcitabine in diverse model systems. Mechanistically, Pin1 drives the 
      desmoplastic and immunosuppressive TME by acting on CAFs and induces lysosomal 
      degradation of the PD-1 ligand PD-L1 and the gemcitabine transporter ENT1 in cancer 
      cells, besides activating multiple cancer pathways. Thus, Pin1 inhibition 
      simultaneously blocks multiple cancer pathways, disrupts the desmoplastic and 
      immunosuppressive TME, and upregulates PD-L1 and ENT1, rendering PDAC eradicable by 
      immunochemotherapy.

AB  - Terminating the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic relies upon pan-global vaccination. Current 
      vaccines elicit neutralizing antibody responses to the virus spike derived from 
      early isolates. However, new strains have emerged with multiple mutations, including 
      P.1 from Brazil, B.1.351 from South Africa, and B.1.1.7 from the UK (12, 10, and 9 
      changes in the spike, respectively). All have mutations in the ACE2 binding site, 
      with P.1 and B.1.351 having a virtually identical triplet (E484K, K417N/T, and 
      N501Y), which we show confer similar increased affinity for ACE2. We show that, 
      surprisingly, P.1 is significantly less resistant to naturally acquired or 
      vaccine-induced antibody responses than B.1.351, suggesting that changes outside the 
      receptor-binding domain (RBD) impact neutralization. Monoclonal antibody (mAb) 222 
      neutralizes all three variants despite interacting with two of the ACE2-binding site 
      mutations. We explain this through structural analysis and use the 222 light chain 
      to largely restore neutralization potency to a major class of public antibodies.

AB  - The integration of mass spectrometry-based proteomics with next-generation DNA and 
      RNA sequencing profiles tumors more comprehensively. Here this "proteogenomics" 
      approach was applied to 122 treatment-naive primary breast cancers accrued to 
      preserve post-translational modifications, including protein phosphorylation and 
      acetylation. Proteogenomics challenged standard breast cancer diagnoses, provided 
      detailed analysis of the ERBB2 amplicon, defined tumor subsets that could benefit 
      from immune checkpoint therapy, and allowed more accurate assessment of Rb status 
      for prediction of CDK4/6 inhibitor responsiveness. Phosphoproteomics profiles 
      uncovered novel associations between tumor suppressor loss and targetable kinases. 
      Acetylproteome analysis highlighted acetylation on key nuclear proteins involved in 
      the DNA damage response and revealed cross-talk between cytoplasmic and 
      mitochondrial acetylation and metabolism. Our results underscore the potential of 
      proteogenomics for clinical investigation of breast cancer through more accurate 
      annotation of targetable pathways and biological features of this remarkably 
      heterogeneous malignancy.

AB  - Rich fossil evidence suggests that many traits and functions related to terrestrial 
      evolution were present long before the ancestor of lobe- and ray-finned fishes. 
      Here, we present genome sequences of the bichir, paddlefish, bowfin, and alligator 
      gar, covering all major early divergent lineages of ray-finned fishes. Our analyses 
      show that these species exhibit many mosaic genomic features of lobe- and ray-finned 
      fishes. In particular, many regulatory elements for limb development are present in 
      these fishes, supporting the hypothesis that the relevant ancestral regulation 
      networks emerged before the origin of tetrapods. Transcriptome analyses confirm the 
      homology between the lung and swim bladder and reveal the presence of functional 
      lung-related genes in early ray-finned fishes. Furthermore, we functionally validate 
      the essential role of a jawed vertebrate highly conserved element for cardiovascular 
      development. Our results imply the ancestors of jawed vertebrates already had the 
      potential gene networks for cardio-respiratory systems supporting air breathing.

AB  - The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 led to pandemic spread of coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19), manifesting with respiratory symptoms and multi-organ dysfunction. 
      Detailed characterization of virus-neutralizing antibodies and target epitopes is 
      needed to understand COVID-19 pathophysiology and guide immunization strategies. 
      Among 598 human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from 10 COVID-19 patients, we 
      identified 40 strongly neutralizing mAbs. The most potent mAb, CV07-209, neutralized 
      authentic SARS-CoV-2 with an IC(50) value of 3.1 ng/mL. Crystal structures of two 
      mAbs in complex with the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain at 2.55 and 2.70 Å 
      revealed a direct block of ACE2 attachment. Interestingly, some of the near-germline 
      SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing mAbs reacted with mammalian self-antigens. Prophylactic and 
      therapeutic application of CV07-209 protected hamsters from SARS-CoV-2 infection, 
      weight loss, and lung pathology. Our results show that non-self-reactive 
      virus-neutralizing mAbs elicited during SARS-CoV-2 infection are a promising 
      therapeutic strategy.

AB  - Histone H3.3 glycine 34 to arginine/valine (G34R/V) mutations drive deadly gliomas 
      and show exquisite regional and temporal specificity, suggesting a developmental 
      context permissive to their effects. Here we show that 50% of G34R/V tumors (n = 95) 
      bear activating PDGFRA mutations that display strong selection pressure at 
      recurrence. Although considered gliomas, G34R/V tumors actually arise in 
      GSX2/DLX-expressing interneuron progenitors, where G34R/V mutations impair neuronal 
      differentiation. The lineage of origin may facilitate PDGFRA co-option through a 
      chromatin loop connecting PDGFRA to GSX2 regulatory elements, promoting PDGFRA 
      overexpression and mutation. At the single-cell level, G34R/V tumors harbor dual 
      neuronal/astroglial identity and lack oligodendroglial programs, actively repressed 
      by GSX2/DLX-mediated cell fate specification. G34R/V may become dispensable for 
      tumor maintenance, whereas mutant-PDGFRA is potently oncogenic. Collectively, our 
      results open novel research avenues in deadly tumors. G34R/V gliomas are neuronal 
      malignancies where interneuron progenitors are stalled in differentiation by G34R/V 
      mutations and malignant gliogenesis is promoted by co-option of a potentially 
      targetable pathway, PDGFRA signaling.

AB  - Cardiac injury and dysfunction occur in COVID-19 patients and increase the risk of 
      mortality. Causes are ill defined but could be through direct cardiac infection 
      and/or inflammation-induced dysfunction. To identify mechanisms and 
      cardio-protective drugs, we use a state-of-the-art pipeline combining human cardiac 
      organoids with phosphoproteomics and single nuclei RNA sequencing. We identify an 
      inflammatory "cytokine-storm", a cocktail of interferon gamma, interleukin 1β, and 
      poly(I:C), induced diastolic dysfunction. Bromodomain-containing protein 4 is 
      activated along with a viral response that is consistent in both human cardiac 
      organoids (hCOs) and hearts of SARS-CoV-2-infected K18-hACE2 mice. Bromodomain and 
      extraterminal family inhibitors (BETi) recover dysfunction in hCOs and completely 
      prevent cardiac dysfunction and death in a mouse cytokine-storm model. Additionally, 
      BETi decreases transcription of genes in the viral response, decreases ACE2 
      expression, and reduces SARS-CoV-2 infection of cardiomyocytes. Together, BETi, 
      including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) breakthrough designated drug, 
      apabetalone, are promising candidates to prevent COVID-19 mediated cardiac damage.

AB  - Itch is an evolutionarily conserved sensation that facilitates expulsion of 
      pathogens and noxious stimuli from the skin. However, in organ failure, cancer, and 
      chronic inflammatory disorders such as atopic dermatitis (AD), itch becomes chronic, 
      intractable, and debilitating. In addition to chronic itch, patients often 
      experience intense acute itch exacerbations. Recent discoveries have unearthed the 
      neuroimmune circuitry of itch, leading to the development of anti-itch treatments. 
      However, mechanisms underlying acute itch exacerbations remain overlooked. Herein, 
      we identify that a large proportion of patients with AD harbor allergen-specific 
      immunoglobulin E (IgE) and exhibit a propensity for acute itch flares. In mice, 
      while allergen-provoked acute itch is mediated by the mast cell-histamine axis in 
      steady state, AD-associated inflammation renders this pathway dispensable. Instead, 
      a previously unrecognized basophil-leukotriene (LT) axis emerges as critical for 
      acute itch flares. By probing fundamental itch mechanisms, our study highlights a 
      basophil-neuronal circuit that may underlie a variety of neuroimmune processes.

      therapies, including immunotherapies. We profiled the transcriptomes of ∼17,000 
      cells from 18 primary or early-relapse HCC cases. Early-relapse tumors have reduced 
      levels of regulatory T cells, increased dendritic cells (DCs), and increased 
      infiltrated CD8(+) T cells, compared with primary tumors, in two independent 
      cohorts. Remarkably, CD8(+) T cells in recurrent tumors overexpressed KLRB1 (CD161) 
      and displayed an innate-like low cytotoxic state, with low clonal expansion, unlike 
      the classical exhausted state observed in primary HCC. The enrichment of these cells 
      was associated with a worse prognosis. Differential gene expression and interaction 
      analyses revealed potential immune evasion mechanisms in recurrent tumor cells that 
      dampen DC antigen presentation and recruit innate-like CD8(+) T cells. Our 
      comprehensive picture of the HCC ecosystem provides deeper insights into immune 
      evasion mechanisms associated with tumor relapse.

AB  - Despite the established dogma of central nervous system (CNS) immune privilege, 
      neuroimmune interactions play an active role in diverse neurological disorders. 
      However, the precise mechanisms underlying CNS immune surveillance remain elusive; 
      particularly, the anatomical sites where peripheral adaptive immunity can sample 
      CNS-derived antigens and the cellular and molecular mediators orchestrating this 
      surveillance. Here, we demonstrate that CNS-derived antigens in the cerebrospinal 
      fluid (CSF) accumulate around the dural sinuses, are captured by local 
      antigen-presenting cells, and are presented to patrolling T cells. This surveillance 
      is enabled by endothelial and mural cells forming the sinus stromal niche. T cell 
      recognition of CSF-derived antigens at this site promoted tissue resident phenotypes 
      and effector functions within the dural meninges. These findings highlight the 
      critical role of dural sinuses as a neuroimmune interface, where brain antigens are 
      surveyed under steady-state conditions, and shed light on age-related dysfunction 
      and neuroinflammatory attack in animal models of multiple sclerosis.

AB  - We report a comprehensive proteogenomics analysis, including whole-genome 
      sequencing, RNA sequencing, and proteomics and phosphoproteomics profiling, of 218 
      tumors across 7 histological types of childhood brain cancer: low-grade glioma (n = 
      93), ependymoma (32), high-grade glioma (25), medulloblastoma (22), ganglioglioma 
      (18), craniopharyngioma (16), and atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (12). Proteomics 
      data identify common biological themes that span histological boundaries, suggesting 
      that treatments used for one histological type may be applied effectively to other 
      tumors sharing similar proteomics features. Immune landscape characterization 
      reveals diverse tumor microenvironments across and within diagnoses. Proteomics data 
      further reveal functional effects of somatic mutations and copy number variations 
      (CNVs) not evident in transcriptomics data. Kinase-substrate association and 
      co-expression network analysis identify important biological mechanisms of 
      tumorigenesis. This is the first large-scale proteogenomics analysis across 
      traditional histological boundaries to uncover foundational pediatric brain tumor 
      biology and inform rational treatment selection.

AB  - The D1- and D2-dopamine receptors (D1R and D2R), which signal through G(s) and G(i), 
      respectively, represent the principal stimulatory and inhibitory dopamine receptors 
      in the central nervous system. D1R and D2R also represent the main therapeutic 
      targets for Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and many other neuropsychiatric 
      disorders, and insight into their signaling is essential for understanding both 
      therapeutic and side effects of dopaminergic drugs. Here, we report four 
      cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of D1R-G(s) and D2R-G(i) signaling 
      complexes with selective and non-selective dopamine agonists, including two 
      currently used anti-Parkinson's disease drugs, apomorphine and bromocriptine. These 
      structures, together with mutagenesis studies, reveal the conserved binding mode of 
      dopamine agonists, the unique pocket topology underlying ligand selectivity, the 
      conformational changes in receptor activation, and potential structural determinants 
      for G protein-coupling selectivity. These results provide both a molecular 
      understanding of dopamine signaling and multiple structural templates for drug 
      design targeting the dopaminergic system.

AB  - Many oncogenic insults deregulate RNA splicing, often leading to hypersensitivity of 
      tumors to spliceosome-targeted therapies (STTs). However, the mechanisms by which 
      STTs selectively kill cancers remain largely unknown. Herein, we discover that 
      mis-spliced RNA itself is a molecular trigger for tumor killing through viral 
      mimicry. In MYC-driven triple-negative breast cancer, STTs cause widespread 
      cytoplasmic accumulation of mis-spliced mRNAs, many of which form double-stranded 
      structures. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-binding proteins recognize these endogenous 
      dsRNAs, triggering antiviral signaling and extrinsic apoptosis. In immune-competent 
      models of breast cancer, STTs cause tumor cell-intrinsic antiviral signaling, 
      downstream adaptive immune signaling, and tumor cell death. Furthermore, RNA 
      mis-splicing in human breast cancers correlates with innate and adaptive immune 
      signatures, especially in MYC-amplified tumors that are typically immune cold. These 
      findings indicate that dsRNA-sensing pathways respond to global aberrations of RNA 
      splicing in cancer and provoke the hypothesis that STTs may provide unexplored 
      strategies to activate anti-tumor immune pathways.

AB  - Neoantigens arise from mutations in cancer cells and are important targets of 
      T cell-mediated anti-tumor immunity. Here, we report the first open-label, phase Ib 
      clinical trial of a personalized neoantigen-based vaccine, NEO-PV-01, in combination 
      with PD-1 blockade in patients with advanced melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, 
      or bladder cancer. This analysis of 82 patients demonstrated that the regimen was 
      safe, with no treatment-related serious adverse events observed. De novo 
      neoantigen-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell responses were observed 
      post-vaccination in all of the patients. The vaccine-induced T cells had a cytotoxic 
      phenotype and were capable of trafficking to the tumor and mediating cell killing. 
      In addition, epitope spread to neoantigens not included in the vaccine was detected 
      post-vaccination. These data support the safety and immunogenicity of this regimen 
      in patients with advanced solid tumors (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02897765).

AB  - A dysfunctional immune response in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients is a 
      recurrent theme impacting symptoms and mortality, yet a detailed understanding of 
      pertinent immune cells is not complete. We applied single-cell RNA sequencing to 284 
      samples from 196 COVID-19 patients and controls and created a comprehensive immune 
      landscape with 1.46 million cells. The large dataset enabled us to identify that 
      different peripheral immune subtype changes are associated with distinct clinical 
      features, including age, sex, severity, and disease stages of COVID-19. Severe acute 
      respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was found in diverse epithelial 
      and immune cell types, accompanied by dramatic transcriptomic changes within 
      virus-positive cells. Systemic upregulation of S100A8/A9, mainly by megakaryocytes 
      and monocytes in the peripheral blood, may contribute to the cytokine storms 
      frequently observed in severe patients. Our data provide a rich resource for 
      understanding the pathogenesis of and developing effective therapeutic strategies 
      for COVID-19.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 has caused over 2 million deaths in little over a year. Vaccines are 
      being deployed at scale, aiming to generate responses against the virus spike. The 
      scale of the pandemic and error-prone virus replication is leading to the appearance 
      of mutant viruses and potentially escape from antibody responses. Variant B.1.1.7, 
      now dominant in the UK, with increased transmission, harbors 9 amino acid changes in 
      the spike, including N501Y in the ACE2 interacting surface. We examine the ability 
      of B.1.1.7 to evade antibody responses elicited by natural SARS-CoV-2 infection or 
      vaccination. We map the impact of N501Y by structure/function analysis of a large 
      panel of well-characterized monoclonal antibodies. B.1.1.7 is harder to neutralize 
      than parental virus, compromising neutralization by some members of a major class of 
      public antibodies through light-chain contacts with residue 501. However, widespread 
      escape from monoclonal antibodies or antibody responses generated by natural 
      infection or vaccination was not observed.

AB  - Although treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with immune checkpoint 
      inhibitors (ICIs) can produce remarkably durable responses, most patients develop 
      early disease progression. Furthermore, initial response assessment by conventional 
      imaging is often unable to identify which patients will achieve durable clinical 
      benefit (DCB). Here, we demonstrate that pre-treatment circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) 
      and peripheral CD8 T cell levels are independently associated with DCB. We further 
      show that ctDNA dynamics after a single infusion can aid in identification of 
      patients who will achieve DCB. Integrating these determinants, we developed and 
      validated an entirely noninvasive multiparameter assay (DIREct-On, Durable 
      Immunotherapy Response Estimation by immune profiling and ctDNA-On-treatment) that 
      robustly predicts which patients will achieve DCB with higher accuracy than any 
      individual feature. Taken together, these results demonstrate that integrated ctDNA 
      and circulating immune cell profiling can provide accurate, noninvasive, and early 
      forecasting of ultimate outcomes for NSCLC patients receiving ICIs.

AB  - Cancer genomes often harbor hundreds of somatic DNA rearrangement junctions, many of 
      which cannot be easily classified into simple (e.g., deletion) or complex (e.g., 
      chromothripsis) structural variant classes. Applying a novel genome graph 
      computational paradigm to analyze the topology of junction copy number (JCN) across 
      2,778 tumor whole-genome sequences, we uncovered three novel complex rearrangement 
      phenomena: pyrgo, rigma, and tyfonas. Pyrgo are "towers" of low-JCN duplications 
      associated with early-replicating regions, superenhancers, and breast or ovarian 
      cancers. Rigma comprise "chasms" of low-JCN deletions enriched in late-replicating 
      fragile sites and gastrointestinal carcinomas. Tyfonas are "typhoons" of high-JCN 
      junctions and fold-back inversions associated with expressed protein-coding fusions, 
      breakend hypermutation, and acral, but not cutaneous, melanomas. Clustering of 
      tumors according to genome graph-derived features identified subgroups associated 
      with DNA repair defects and poor prognosis.

AB  - Intra-tumor heterogeneity (ITH) is a mechanism of therapeutic resistance and 
      therefore an important clinical challenge. However, the extent, origin, and drivers 
      of ITH across cancer types are poorly understood. To address this, we extensively 
      characterize ITH across whole-genome sequences of 2,658 cancer samples spanning 38 
      cancer types. Nearly all informative samples (95.1%) contain evidence of distinct 
      subclonal expansions with frequent branching relationships between subclones. We 
      observe positive selection of subclonal driver mutations across most cancer types 
      and identify cancer type-specific subclonal patterns of driver gene mutations, 
      fusions, structural variants, and copy number alterations as well as dynamic changes 
      in mutational processes between subclonal expansions. Our results underline the 
      importance of ITH and its drivers in tumor evolution and provide a pan-cancer 
      resource of comprehensively annotated subclonal events from whole-genome sequencing 
      data.

AB  - Industrialization has impacted the human gut ecosystem, resulting in altered 
      microbiome composition and diversity. Whether bacterial genomes may also adapt to 
      the industrialization of their host populations remains largely unexplored. Here, we 
      investigate the extent to which the rates and targets of horizontal gene transfer 
      (HGT) vary across thousands of bacterial strains from 15 human populations spanning 
      a range of industrialization. We show that HGTs have accumulated in the microbiome 
      over recent host generations and that HGT occurs at high frequency within 
      individuals. Comparison across human populations reveals that industrialized 
      lifestyles are associated with higher HGT rates and that the functions of HGTs are 
      related to the level of host industrialization. Our results suggest that gut 
      bacteria continuously acquire new functionality based on host lifestyle and that 
      high rates of HGT may be a recent development in human history linked to 
      industrialization.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can cause acute 
      respiratory disease and multiorgan failure. Finding human host factors that are 
      essential for SARS-CoV-2 infection could facilitate the formulation of treatment 
      strategies. Using a human kidney cell line-HK-2-that is highly susceptible to 
      SARS-CoV-2, we performed a genome-wide RNAi screen and identified virus dependency 
      factors (VDFs), which play regulatory roles in biological pathways linked to 
      clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found a role for a secretory 
      form of SARS-CoV-2 receptor, soluble angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (sACE2), in 
      SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further investigation revealed that SARS-CoV-2 exploits 
      receptor-mediated endocytosis through interaction between its spike with sACE2 or 
      sACE2-vasopressin via AT1 or AVPR1B, respectively. Our identification of VDFs and 
      the regulatory effect of sACE2 on SARS-CoV-2 infection shed insight into 
      pathogenesis and cell entry mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 as well as potential treatment 
      strategies for COVID-19.

AB  - Inborn errors of human interferon gamma (IFN-γ) immunity underlie mycobacterial 
      disease. We report a patient with mycobacterial disease due to inherited deficiency 
      of the transcription factor T-bet. The patient has extremely low counts of 
      circulating Mycobacterium-reactive natural killer (NK), invariant NKT (iNKT), 
      mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT), and Vδ2(+) γδ T lymphocytes, and of 
      Mycobacterium-non reactive classic T(H)1 lymphocytes, with the residual populations 
      of these cells also producing abnormally small amounts of IFN-γ. Other lymphocyte 
      subsets develop normally but produce low levels of IFN-γ, with the exception of 
      CD8(+) αβ T and non-classic CD4(+) αβ T(H)1(∗) lymphocytes, which produce IFN-γ 
      normally in response to mycobacterial antigens. Human T-bet deficiency thus 
      underlies mycobacterial disease by preventing the development of innate (NK) and 
      innate-like adaptive lymphocytes (iNKT, MAIT, and Vδ2(+) γδ T cells) and IFN-γ 
      production by them, with mycobacterium-specific, IFN-γ-producing, purely adaptive 
      CD8(+) αβ T, and CD4(+) αβ T(H)1(∗) cells unable to compensate for this deficit.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a mild to moderate respiratory tract 
      infection, however, a subset of patients progress to severe disease and respiratory 
      failure. The mechanism of protective immunity in mild forms and the pathogenesis of 
      severe COVID-19 associated with increased neutrophil counts and dysregulated immune 
      responses remain unclear. In a dual-center, two-cohort study, we combined 
      single-cell RNA-sequencing and single-cell proteomics of whole-blood and 
      peripheral-blood mononuclear cells to determine changes in immune cell composition 
      and activation in mild versus severe COVID-19 (242 samples from 109 individuals) 
      over time. HLA-DR(hi)CD11c(hi) inflammatory monocytes with an interferon-stimulated 
      gene signature were elevated in mild COVID-19. Severe COVID-19 was marked by 
      occurrence of neutrophil precursors, as evidence of emergency myelopoiesis, 
      dysfunctional mature neutrophils, and HLA-DR(lo) monocytes. Our study provides 
      detailed insights into the systemic immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and 
      reveals profound alterations in the myeloid cell compartment associated with severe 
      COVID-19.

AB  - Checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) augment adaptive immunity. Systematic pan-tumor 
      analyses may reveal the relative importance of tumor-cell-intrinsic and 
      microenvironmental features underpinning CPI sensitization. Here, we collated 
      whole-exome and transcriptomic data for >1,000 CPI-treated patients across seven 
      tumor types, utilizing standardized bioinformatics workflows and clinical outcome 
      criteria to validate multivariable predictors of CPI sensitization. Clonal tumor 
      mutation burden (TMB) was the strongest predictor of CPI response, followed by total 
      TMB and CXCL9 expression. Subclonal TMB, somatic copy alteration burden, and 
      histocompatibility leukocyte antigen (HLA) evolutionary divergence failed to attain 
      pan-cancer significance. Dinucleotide variants were identified as a source of 
      immunogenic epitopes associated with radical amino acid substitutions and enhanced 
      peptide hydrophobicity/immunogenicity. Copy-number analysis revealed two additional 
      determinants of CPI outcome supported by prior functional evidence: 9q34 (TRAF2) 
      loss associated with response and CCND1 amplification associated with resistance. 
      Finally, single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of clonal neoantigen-reactive CD8 
      tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), combined with bulk RNA-seq analysis of 
      CPI-responding tumors, identified CCR5 and CXCL13 as T-cell-intrinsic markers of CPI 
      sensitivity.

AB  - T cells are critical effectors of cancer immunotherapies, but little is known about 
      their gene expression programs in diffuse gliomas. Here, we leverage single-cell RNA 
      sequencing (RNA-seq) to chart the gene expression and clonal landscape of 
      tumor-infiltrating T cells across 31 patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 
      wild-type glioblastoma and IDH mutant glioma. We identify potential effectors of 
      anti-tumor immunity in subsets of T cells that co-express cytotoxic programs and 
      several natural killer (NK) cell genes. Analysis of clonally expanded 
      tumor-infiltrating T cells further identifies the NK gene KLRB1 (encoding CD161) as 
      a candidate inhibitory receptor. Accordingly, genetic inactivation of KLRB1 or 
      antibody-mediated CD161 blockade enhances T cell-mediated killing of glioma cells 
      in vitro and their anti-tumor function in vivo. KLRB1 and its associated 
      transcriptional program are also expressed by substantial T cell populations in 
      other human cancers. Our work provides an atlas of T cells in gliomas and highlights 
      CD161 and other NK cell receptors as immunotherapy targets.

AB  - We present a global atlas of 4,728 metagenomic samples from mass-transit systems in 
      60 cities over 3 years, representing the first systematic, worldwide catalog of the 
      urban microbial ecosystem. This atlas provides an annotated, geospatial profile of 
      microbial strains, functional characteristics, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) 
      markers, and genetic elements, including 10,928 viruses, 1,302 bacteria, 2 archaea, 
      and 838,532 CRISPR arrays not found in reference databases. We identified 4,246 
      known species of urban microorganisms and a consistent set of 31 species found in 
      97% of samples that were distinct from human commensal organisms. Profiles of AMR 
      genes varied widely in type and density across cities. Cities showed distinct 
      microbial taxonomic signatures that were driven by climate and geographic 
      differences. These results constitute a high-resolution global metagenomic atlas 
      that enables discovery of organisms and genes, highlights potential public health 
      and forensic applications, and provides a culture-independent view of AMR burden in 
      cities.

AB  - Determining protein levels in each tissue and how they compare with RNA levels is 
      important for understanding human biology and disease as well as regulatory 
      processes that control protein levels. We quantified the relative protein levels 
      from over 12,000 genes across 32 normal human tissues. Tissue-specific or 
      tissue-enriched proteins were identified and compared to transcriptome data. Many 
      ubiquitous transcripts are found to encode tissue-specific proteins. Discordance of 
      RNA and protein enrichment revealed potential sites of synthesis and action of 
      secreted proteins. The tissue-specific distribution of proteins also provides an 
      in-depth view of complex biological events that require the interplay of multiple 
      tissues. Most importantly, our study demonstrated that protein tissue-enrichment 
      information can explain phenotypes of genetic diseases, which cannot be obtained by 
      transcript information alone. Overall, our results demonstrate how understanding 
      protein levels can provide insights into regulation, secretome, metabolism, and 
      human diseases.

AB  - Since the first reports of a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like 
      coronavirus in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, there has been intense interest in 
      understanding how severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
      emerged in the human population. Recent debate has coalesced around two competing 
      ideas: a "laboratory escape" scenario and zoonotic emergence. Here, we critically 
      review the current scientific evidence that may help clarify the origin of 
      SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is 
      initiated by binding of the viral Spike protein to host receptor 
      angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), followed by fusion of viral and host 
      membranes. Although antibodies that block this interaction are in emergency use as 
      early coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) therapies, the precise determinants of 
      neutralization potency remain unknown. We discovered a series of antibodies that 
      potently block ACE2 binding but exhibit divergent neutralization efficacy against 
      the live virus. Strikingly, these neutralizing antibodies can inhibit or enhance 
      Spike-mediated membrane fusion and formation of syncytia, which are associated with 
      chronic tissue damage in individuals with COVID-19. As revealed by cryoelectron 
      microscopy, multiple structures of Spike-antibody complexes have distinct binding 
      modes that not only block ACE2 binding but also alter the Spike protein 
      conformational cycle triggered by ACE2 binding. We show that stabilization of 
      different Spike conformations leads to modulation of Spike-mediated membrane fusion 
      with profound implications for COVID-19 pathology and immunity.

AB  - Positive selection in Europeans at the 2q21.3 locus harboring the lactase gene has 
      been attributed to selection for the ability of adults to digest milk to survive 
      famine in ancient times. However, the 2q21.3 locus is also associated with obesity 
      and type 2 diabetes in humans, raising the possibility that additional genetic 
      elements in the locus may have contributed to evolutionary adaptation to famine by 
      promoting energy storage, but which now confer susceptibility to metabolic diseases. 
      We show here that the miR-128-1 microRNA, located at the center of the positively 
      selected locus, represents a crucial metabolic regulator in mammals. Antisense 
      targeting and genetic ablation of miR-128-1 in mouse metabolic disease models result 
      in increased energy expenditure and amelioration of high-fat-diet-induced obesity 
      and markedly improved glucose tolerance. A thrifty phenotype connected to 
      miR-128-1-dependent energy storage may link ancient adaptation to famine and modern 
      metabolic maladaptation associated with nutritional overabundance.

AB  - Although mutations in DNA are the best-studied source of neoantigens that determine 
      response to immune checkpoint blockade, alterations in RNA splicing within cancer 
      cells could similarly result in neoepitope production. However, the endogenous 
      antigenicity and clinical potential of such splicing-derived epitopes have not been 
      tested. Here, we demonstrate that pharmacologic modulation of splicing via specific 
      drug classes generates bona fide neoantigens and elicits anti-tumor immunity, 
      augmenting checkpoint immunotherapy. Splicing modulation inhibited tumor growth and 
      enhanced checkpoint blockade in a manner dependent on host T cells and peptides 
      presented on tumor MHC class I. Splicing modulation induced stereotyped splicing 
      changes across tumor types, altering the MHC I-bound immunopeptidome to yield 
      splicing-derived neoepitopes that trigger an anti-tumor T cell response in vivo. 
      These data definitively identify splicing modulation as an untapped source of 
      immunogenic peptides and provide a means to enhance response to checkpoint blockade 
      that is readily translatable to the clinic.

AB  - In order to analyze how a signal transduction network converts cellular inputs into 
      cellular outputs, ideally one would measure the dynamics of many signals within the 
      network simultaneously. We found that, by fusing a fluorescent reporter to a pair of 
      self-assembling peptides, it could be stably clustered within cells at random 
      points, distant enough to be resolved by a microscope but close enough to spatially 
      sample the relevant biology. Because such clusters, which we call signaling reporter 
      islands (SiRIs), can be modularly designed, they permit a set of fluorescent 
      reporters to be efficiently adapted for simultaneous measurement of multiple nodes 
      of a signal transduction network within single cells. We created SiRIs for 
      indicators of second messengers and kinases and used them, in hippocampal neurons in 
      culture and intact brain slices, to discover relationships between the speed of 
      calcium signaling, and the amplitude of PKA signaling, upon receiving a cAMP-driving 
      stimulus.

AB  - The December 2019 outbreak of a novel respiratory virus, SARS-CoV-2, has become an 
      ongoing global pandemic due in part to the challenge of identifying symptomatic, 
      asymptomatic, and pre-symptomatic carriers of the virus. CRISPR diagnostics can 
      augment gold-standard PCR-based testing if they can be made rapid, portable, and 
      accurate. Here, we report the development of an amplification-free CRISPR-Cas13a 
      assay for direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 from nasal swab RNA that can be read with a 
      mobile phone microscope. The assay achieved ∼100 copies/μL sensitivity in under 
      30 min of measurement time and accurately detected pre-extracted RNA from a set of 
      positive clinical samples in under 5 min. We combined crRNAs targeting SARS-CoV-2 
      RNA to improve sensitivity and specificity and directly quantified viral load using 
      enzyme kinetics. Integrated with a reader device based on a mobile phone, this assay 
      has the potential to enable rapid, low-cost, point-of-care screening for SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - The characterization of cancer genomes has provided insight into somatically altered 
      genes across tumors, transformed our understanding of cancer biology, and enabled 
      tailoring of therapeutic strategies. However, the function of most cancer alleles 
      remains mysterious, and many cancer features transcend their genomes. Consequently, 
      tumor genomic characterization does not influence therapy for most patients. 
      Approaches to understand the function and circuitry of cancer genes provide 
      complementary approaches to elucidate both oncogene and non-oncogene dependencies. 
      Emerging work indicates that the diversity of therapeutic targets engendered by 
      non-oncogene dependencies is much larger than the list of recurrently mutated genes. 
      Here we describe a framework for this expanded list of cancer targets, providing 
      novel opportunities for clinical translation.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has made deployment of an effective vaccine a 
      global health priority. We evaluated the protective activity of a chimpanzee 
      adenovirus-vectored vaccine encoding a prefusion stabilized spike protein 
      (ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S) in challenge studies with severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and mice expressing the human angiotensin-converting 
      enzyme 2 receptor. Intramuscular dosing of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S induces robust systemic 
      humoral and cell-mediated immune responses and protects against lung infection, 
      inflammation, and pathology but does not confer sterilizing immunity, as evidenced 
      by detection of viral RNA and induction of anti-nucleoprotein antibodies after 
      SARS-CoV-2 challenge. In contrast, a single intranasal dose of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S 
      induces high levels of neutralizing antibodies, promotes systemic and mucosal 
      immunoglobulin A (IgA) and T cell responses, and almost entirely prevents SARS-CoV-2 
      infection in both the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Intranasal administration 
      of ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S is a candidate for preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection and 
      transmission and curtailing pandemic spread.

AB  - Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are a focus in vaccine and therapeutic design to 
      counteract severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its 
      variants. Here, we combined B cell sorting with single-cell VDJ and RNA sequencing 
      (RNA-seq) and mAb structures to characterize B cell responses against SARS-CoV-2. We 
      show that the SARS-CoV-2-specific B cell repertoire consists of transcriptionally 
      distinct B cell populations with cells producing potently neutralizing antibodies 
      (nAbs) localized in two clusters that resemble memory and activated B cells. 
      Cryo-electron microscopy structures of selected nAbs from these two clusters 
      complexed with SARS-CoV-2 spike trimers show recognition of various receptor-binding 
      domain (RBD) epitopes. One of these mAbs, BG10-19, locks the spike trimer in a 
      closed conformation to potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2, the recently arising mutants 
      B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, and SARS-CoV and cross-reacts with heterologous RBDs. Together, 
      our results characterize transcriptional differences among SARS-CoV-2-specific B 
      cells and uncover cross-neutralizing Ab targets that will inform immunogen and 
      therapeutic design against coronaviruses.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 can mutate and evade immunity, with consequences for efficacy of emerging 
      vaccines and antibody therapeutics. Here, we demonstrate that the immunodominant 
      SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) receptor binding motif (RBM) is a highly variable region of S 
      and provide epidemiological, clinical, and molecular characterization of a 
      prevalent, sentinel RBM mutation, N439K. We demonstrate N439K S protein has enhanced 
      binding affinity to the hACE2 receptor, and N439K viruses have similar in vitro 
      replication fitness and cause infections with similar clinical outcomes as compared 
      to wild type. We show the N439K mutation confers resistance against several 
      neutralizing monoclonal antibodies, including one authorized for emergency use by 
      the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and reduces the activity of some 
      polyclonal sera from persons recovered from infection. Immune evasion mutations that 
      maintain virulence and fitness such as N439K can emerge within SARS-CoV-2 S, 
      highlighting the need for ongoing molecular surveillance to guide development and 
      usage of vaccines and therapeutics.

AB  - Ultraviolet (UV) light and incompletely understood genetic and epigenetic variations 
      determine skin color. Here we describe an UV- and microphthalmia-associated 
      transcription factor (MITF)-independent mechanism of skin pigmentation. Targeting 
      the mitochondrial redox-regulating enzyme nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase 
      (NNT) resulted in cellular redox changes that affect tyrosinase degradation. These 
      changes regulate melanosome maturation and, consequently, eumelanin levels and 
      pigmentation. Topical application of small-molecule inhibitors yielded skin 
      darkening in human skin, and mice with decreased NNT function displayed increased 
      pigmentation. Additionally, genetic modification of NNT in zebrafish alters 
      melanocytic pigmentation. Analysis of four diverse human cohorts revealed 
      significant associations of skin color, tanning, and sun protection use with various 
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms within NNT. NNT levels were independent of UVB 
      irradiation and redox modulation. Individuals with postinflammatory 
      hyperpigmentation or lentigines displayed decreased skin NNT levels, suggesting an 
      NNT-driven, redox-dependent pigmentation mechanism that can be targeted with 
      NNT-modifying topical drugs for medical and cosmetic purposes.

AB  - Antibodies are crucial to immune protection against SARS-CoV-2, with some in 
      emergency use as therapeutics. Here, we identify 377 human monoclonal antibodies 
      (mAbs) recognizing the virus spike and focus mainly on 80 that bind the receptor 
      binding domain (RBD). We devise a competition data-driven method to map RBD binding 
      sites. We find that although antibody binding sites are widely dispersed, 
      neutralizing antibody binding is focused, with nearly all highly inhibitory mAbs 
      (IC(50) < 0.1 μg/mL) blocking receptor interaction, except for one that binds a 
      unique epitope in the N-terminal domain. Many of these neutralizing mAbs use public 
      V-genes and are close to germline. We dissect the structural basis of recognition 
      for this large panel of antibodies through X-ray crystallography and cryoelectron 
      microscopy of 19 Fab-antigen structures. We find novel binding modes for some 
      potently inhibitory antibodies and demonstrate that strongly neutralizing mAbs 
      protect, prophylactically or therapeutically, in animal models.

AB  - T cell-mediated immunity plays an important role in controlling SARS-CoV-2 
      infection, but the repertoire of naturally processed and presented viral epitopes on 
      class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA-I) remains uncharacterized. Here, we report the 
      first HLA-I immunopeptidome of SARS-CoV-2 in two cell lines at different times post 
      infection using mass spectrometry. We found HLA-I peptides derived not only from 
      canonical open reading frames (ORFs) but also from internal out-of-frame ORFs in 
      spike and nucleocapsid not captured by current vaccines. Some peptides from 
      out-of-frame ORFs elicited T cell responses in a humanized mouse model and 
      individuals with COVID-19 that exceeded responses to canonical peptides, including 
      some of the strongest epitopes reported to date. Whole-proteome analysis of infected 
      cells revealed that early expressed viral proteins contribute more to HLA-I 
      presentation and immunogenicity. These biological insights, as well as the discovery 
      of out-of-frame ORF epitopes, will facilitate selection of peptides for immune 
      monitoring and vaccine development.

AB  - Osteoarthritis affects over 300 million people worldwide. Here, we conduct a 
      genome-wide association study meta-analysis across 826,690 individuals (177,517 with 
      osteoarthritis) and identify 100 independently associated risk variants across 11 
      osteoarthritis phenotypes, 52 of which have not been associated with the disease 
      before. We report thumb and spine osteoarthritis risk variants and identify 
      differences in genetic effects between weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing joints. 
      We identify sex-specific and early age-at-onset osteoarthritis risk loci. We 
      integrate functional genomics data from primary patient tissues (including articular 
      cartilage, subchondral bone, and osteophytic cartilage) and identify high-confidence 
      effector genes. We provide evidence for genetic correlation with phenotypes related 
      to pain, the main disease symptom, and identify likely causal genes linked to 
      neuronal processes. Our results provide insights into key molecular players in 
      disease processes and highlight attractive drug targets to accelerate translation.
